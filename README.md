# Transcripts

These are transcripts of old episodes of the excellent podcast [Rationally Speaking](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/).

These episodes have been run through an [automated speech-to-text program](https://virtualspeech.com/audio-to-text-converter) (which I did help to build) and then _lightly_ proofread.

If you see any errors or any room for improvement, please don't hesitate to raise an issue or submit a pull request!

# Picks

I have collated the Rationally Speaking 'Picks' (recommendations) and they can be [viewed interactively](https://flatgithub.com/rasoolsomji/rationally-speaking-podcast) using [GitHub's "Flat Viewer"](https://github.com/githubocto/flat-viewer).

I have added tags for ease of filtering.

# Affiliation

I am not affiliated with Rationally Speaking or NYC skeptics.
