These are transcripts of old episodes of the excellent podcast [Rationally Speaking](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/).

I am not affiliated with Rationally Speaking or NYC skeptics.

These episodes have been run through an [automated speech-to-text program(https://virtualspeech.com/audio-to-text-converter) (which I did help to build) and then _lightly_ proofread.

If you see any errors or any room for improvement, please don't hesitate to raise an issue or submit a pull request!
