97,Better Angels Of Our Nature by Steven Pinker,Peter Singer,"I think it's a it's a really interesting study and for people who think that, you know, the world is really bad, it's getting worse and worse, it's getting more and more violent. There was a bomb that went off here. There's this war going on there. It's a it's a really good antidote to that kind of pessimism, because I think Pinker shows fairly clearly that if you look at things over the course of history, for any given individual, the chances of dying a violent death at the hands of other human beings are lower now then they have ever been. And they've been getting progressively lower over the centuries and over the millennia. So that in fact we are justified in feeling more secure, were justified in feeling that we are making progress towards a more civilised world, a less violent world than we have ever been in before.",,"history, book"

108,Farewell to Reality: How Modern Physics Has Betrayed the Search for Scientific Truth by Jim Baggott,Massimo,"The book goes through some interesting sort of history of what he calls the authorised version of the view of the world according to physics. So they understand their model in the search for the unified theory and all that. And then he gets into the second party, gets into what he calls the grand delusion where he thinks physics as essentially abandoned or is about to abandon science as we know it. And it's getting into highly speculative and completely impossible to test notions, including things like string theory and parallel universes.",,"book, science"
