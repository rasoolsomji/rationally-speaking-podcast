97,Better Angels Of Our Nature by Steven Pinker,Peter Singer,"I think it's a it's a really interesting study and for people who think that, you know, the world is really bad, it's getting worse and worse, it's getting more and more violent. There was a bomb that went off here. There's this war going on there. It's a it's a really good antidote to that kind of pessimism, because I think Pinker shows fairly clearly that if you look at things over the course of history, for any given individual, the chances of dying a violent death at the hands of other human beings are lower now then they have ever been. And they've been getting progressively lower over the centuries and over the millennia. So that in fact we are justified in feeling more secure, were justified in feeling that we are making progress towards a more civilised world, a less violent world than we have ever been in before.",https://uk.bookshop.org/books/the-better-angels-of-our-nature-a-history-of-violence-and-humanity/9780141034645,"history, book"

108,Farewell to Reality: How Modern Physics Has Betrayed the Search for Scientific Truth by Jim Baggott,Massimo,"The book goes through some interesting sort of history of what he calls the authorised version of the view of the world according to physics. So they understand their model in the search for the unified theory and all that. And then he gets into the second party, gets into what he calls the grand delusion where he thinks physics as essentially abandoned or is about to abandon science as we know it. And it's getting into highly speculative and completely impossible to test notions, including things like string theory and parallel universes.",https://uk.bookshop.org/books/farewell-to-reality-how-fairytale-physics-betrays-the-search-for-scientific-truth/9781780334929,"book, science"
121,Open Philanthropy Project,Benjamin Todd,"In 2012 Givewell partnered with Good Ventures, which is a multibillion dollar foundation set up by Cari Tuna and Dustin Moskovitz, who's one of the co founders of Facebook, and they've now formed a project which is branded separately called the Open Philanthropy Project and its aims is to spend those several billion dollars in the way that has the largest social impact according to their values, which they they expressed generally as global humanitarianism. So the main thing being that people's lives have equal value.",openphilanthropyproject.org,"alturism, blog, website"
135,The Mating Mind by Geoffrey Miller,Robin Hanson,"It was a book that very much influenced me 15 years ago when I was first trying to make sense of a wide range of strange things people were doing. He offered a grand ambitious hypothesis that tried to explain a wide range of puzzling human behavior, and that was inspiring to me to try to take on that level of ambition and scope. In the end, I'm not sure I'm that persuaded by the particular hypothesis he came up with. It has some plausibility. But I was more just drawn to the attempt and the spirit of it, of trying to make sense of a lot of strange things people do. Just realizing that a lot of what people do is strange, that's right on the face of it. Once you see it, it's kind of obvious, but we just miss it unless somebody points it out.",https://uk.bookshop.org/books/the-mating-mind-how-sexual-choice-shaped-the-evolution-of-human-nature/9780099288244,"book, psychology"
136,The Origins of Political Order by Francis Fukuyama,David Roodman,"It provides a predominantly political history of India, China, Europe, and then the United States once it came along. And it’s a comparative history of these regions. I guess the Middle East as well up through 1800. It really helped me appreciate what makes China different from India, and what makes China today so much like China of 2,000 years ago. The continuities over time are really quite extraordinary. It’s one of the books I’ve read recently that has most helped me understand the world.",https://uk.bookshop.org/books/the-origins-of-political-order-from-prehuman-times-to-the-french-revolution/9781846682575,"politics, history, book"

142,Hannibal Season 3,Paul Bloom,"The whole show is filled with monsters and serial killers and psychiatrists. Two episodes ago, one of the psychiatrists -- who was also a murderer played by the woman who played Scully in The X-Files -- turned to the main character and said very carefully, ""Great acts of cruelty require an immense capacity for empathy.""",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_%28TV_series%29,"TV, fiction, crime, psychology"
144,Superforecasters by Philip Tetlock,Bryan Caplan,"And then the book looks at what exactly is the deal with these people who are great forecasters, what are their cognitive styles, how do they think - and other things like if you put a bunch of superforecasters together, are they super superforecasters? And yeah, they kind of are. This book is one of the most important books of social science ever, really. It goes and shows that while social scientists, and especially pundits, are terrible on their accuracy it’s not because the questions are unsolvable -- rather it's because pundits are mostly entertainers, they're not actually serious thinkers, so we should just ignore them and start paying a lot more attention to Tetlock's Superforecasters.",https://uk.bookshop.org/books/superforecasting-the-art-and-science-of-prediction-9781847947154/9781847947154,"book, rationality"
144,The Problem of Political Authority by Michael Huemer,Bryan Caplan,"It will still not convince most people yet it is the book that I'm very happy to give to people who have very different political views from mine and say look, if you're going to read one book that I recommend on political philosophy ever, this is the book. It just does such a fantastic job. What's great about the book is, it really makes a sincere effort to meet people where they are, to start with premises they already accept and take them to a conclusion that is very different from the one they currently hold. Then along the way say, why is it exactly that you don't want to go and follow this chain of argument through? What exactly was stopping you? This book, there's no obscurantism, no attempt to just go and preach the choir. It's the kind of book that I like, where it takes readers where they are, say here's some things that seem obvious to almost everyone, right? Agree? Right, let's start from there and move on and see where we get.",https://uk.bookshop.org/books/the-problem-of-political-authority-an-examination-of-the-right-to-coerce-and-the-duty-to-obey/9781137281654,"book, politics"
145,Perception in International Politics by Robert Jervis ,Philip Tetlock,I still think it is brilliant. And it persuaded me that political psychology might be a viable field in which to specialize. I think that book had a significant impact on me in a number of ways. It's an old book but it's a good book and I think it's worth reading.,https://uk.bookshop.org/books/perception-and-misperception-in-international-politics-new-edition/9780691175850,"book, politics, psychology"
147,Baseball Abstracts by Bill James ,Andrew Gelman,"What was very impressive about these books was that he one at a time assessed various hypotheses, various ideas about baseball and addressed them with statistics and came up with surprising conclusions and lots of questions. For example, at what age are baseball players most productive? People had looked at that before. Apparently, there was baseball lore which said that baseball players are most productive between the ages of 28 and 32, so Bill James looked at the statistics. It did look like players between the ages of 28 and 32 were the best players, but then he looked more carefully and it turned out that wasn't really true. There's really a selection effect. The players who were staying past the age of 30, which is actually an advanced age in baseball years, were actually the best players. If you looked at the individual players one at a time, it turned out that they're mostly peaking around the age of 27. There was a composition bias. The conventional wisdom was wrong and it was wrong because people weren't directly asking the question that they should've been asking. If you want to know when a player is doing the best, you have to look at a player or adjust for that. Looking at averages is going to give you a different answer. So it's a consistent pattern and you still see this in a lot of statistics, poli-sci, econometrics, where people don't ask the direct questions, sometimes it’s very hard to do that. People analyze the data and they come up with an estimate, but it doesn't directly relate to what they were doing. I read Bill James' books before I was a statistics student at all and I got a lot out of it.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/232465.The_Bill_James_Baseball_Abstract_1986,"book, statistics, sport"
148,The Battle for Christmas by Stephen Nissenbaum,David Kyle Johnson,"It's one of the books that was probably most influential in my research of Christmas and informed me especially in regards to the history of Christmas, so it's not a philosophy book. It was a history book, but it's probably considered one of the seminal if not the seminal work on Christmas history in the last two hundred years… not the ancient history of Christmas but the recent history of Christmas. It basically tells how Christmas developed beginning around the early 1800's and then spanning into the late 1900's, and it is fascinating. It certainly changed the way I think about Christmas in numerous ways. The chapter about our Christmas traditions are old fashioned is largely inspired. In my book the myth that our Christmas traditions are old fashioned is largely inspired by my research that came out of Nissenbaum's book and he talks about different aspects. How Christmas was celebrated in the north and in New York City specifically and how the traditions changed over time, and how it affected certain elements of society, talks about the wassailing tradition which is very, very fascinating, in great detail.",https://archive.org/details/battleforchristm0000niss,"book, history, culture"
149,The Bad Seed by William March,Susan Gelman,"The basic point in the plot is that the reason this little girl is evil is she inherited this from her grandmother who was a serial killer, unbeknownst to the little girl's mother and the serial killer's daughter. It gets revealed over the course of the play. It's an example of appearance verses reality. Someone who looks very innocent on the surface but turns out to have these demons. It's about how genes determine how someone develops. It has a very biased and incorrect view of criminality as linked to genes and part of one's essence. It has a lot of food for thought there.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/467032.The_Bad_Seed,"fiction, book, ethics, crime"
152,Foundations of Ethics edited by Russ Shafer-Landau and Terence Cuneo,Dan Fincke,"It is an anthology covering most of the reading on philosophy scholarship on moral philosophy from the '70s, '80s, '90s and the early 2000s. It was one of the books that has a lot of articles that really opened my eyes to the philosophy complexities that philosophers have really figured out in the Foundations of Ethics. I feel like so much of our public discourse acts like there is no good thought out there about moral foundations. It’s as if we just leave it up to religion or just turn it into a brain science, a cognitive science. But there is a lot of really, really good thought that's been done in the last 40 years and I think that anthology has a number of papers that proved that to me, and changed my views and really influenced them in countless ways. I would recommend that anthology for anyone, who really wants to know what philosophers had to offer to the question in the Foundation of Ethics.",https://uk.bookshop.org/books/foundations-of-ethics-an-anthology/9781405129527,"book, philosophy, ethics"
162,The Princess and The Philosopher by Andrea Nye,Sean Carroll,"And she basically looked up all those letters that Descartes and Elizabeth passed back and forth and she wrote a wonderful, short readable book that has long quotes from the letters, and is both a biography of Elizabeth and a discussion of the philosophical issues that they talk about. She led a very interesting life. She was an Abbess, but she was a politically active one. She was essentially the mayor of the town for all intents and purposes, where the abbey was located, and she interacted with people like William Penn and a lot of the social movements of the time",https://uk.bookshop.org/books/the-princess-and-the-philosopher-letters-of-elisabeth-of-the-palatine-to-renz-descartes/978084769265https://bookshop,"philosophy, history, book"
163,Living Without Free Will by Derk Pereboom,Gregg Caruso,"It's also the one that largely shapes my thinking to this day about optimistic skepticism. I really highly recommend that book, it goes through how one can adopt this perspective and what it means for interpersonal relationships, morality, punishment, and a whole number of other issues.",https://uk.bookshop.org/books/living-without-free-will/9780521029964,"book, philosophy, ethics"
163,Against Moral Responsibility by Bruce Waller,Gregg Caruso,"Although we disagree on certain small features of his account, his views on moral responsibility have probably been, second to Pereboom, the most important in shaping my thinking.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12361985-against-moral-responsibility,"book, philosophy, ethics"
164,Distilling Free-Form Natural Laws from Experimental Data by Michael Schmidt and Hod Lipson,James Evans,"Basically take just raw data from the world and they throw it at this machine learning, robotic algorithm, Bayesian thinker. They both have different forms, and then they discover enormous amounts about really the structure or the form of those things. In the case of Schmidt and Lipson's piece, they take these very quasi-random two-hinge pendulum movements. And they basically throw it at this machine that induces and produces things that look like the manifold equations, the ways in which a physicist might draw those out themselves if they were theoretically articulating them. What's interesting about these pieces is, at least for me, the way they've influenced my thinking is that because of the presence of these assumptions and these ghost theories and these heuristics… with the explosion of increasing data, physical and social data from sensors and also archival data that's extractable, I'm really interested in approaches that weaken the assumptions that we put into our analysis. And in some senses, that allow us to reveal based on last year's data, what the assumptions were that led people to find the structures that they found in the data that they had available to them.",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=5F8D96096BA83C4BCC8E279B2F7CE07A?doi=10.1.1.308.2245&rep=rep1&type=pdf,"article, science, statistics"
164,The Discovery of Structural Form by Charles Kemp and Joshua Tenenbaum,James Evans,"Basically take just raw data from the world and they throw it at this machine learning, robotic algorithm, Bayesian thinker. They both have different forms, and then they discover enormous amounts about really the structure or the form of those things. Kemp and Tenenbaum take association data, email data from the Bush Administration, and they take association data between the characteristics of various emails, and voting data between judges in the Supreme Court and they induce what the form is that characterizes that data. Is it a continuum, as in the case of the Supreme Court? Or is it a tree in the case of the Bush Administration? Or is it another organization? What's interesting about these pieces is, at least for me, the way they've influenced my thinking is that because of the presence of these assumptions and these ghost theories and these heuristics… with the explosion of increasing data, physical and social data from sensors and also archival data that's extractable, I'm really interested in approaches that weaken the assumptions that we put into our analysis. And in some senses, that allow us to reveal based on last year's data, what the assumptions were that led people to find the structures that they found in the data that they had available to them.",https://www.pnas.org/content/105/31/10687,"article, science, statistics"
165,Micromotives and Macrobehavior by Thomas Schelling,Robert Frank,"It's that the actions that perfectly rational individuals choose to undertake, are quite often productive of outcomes that none of them like. I mentioned the example of all standing to get a better view, everybody being unhappy with the result. Why didn't we all remain seated? It would have been more comfortable. There are probably hundreds of examples like that that Schelling develops, and it's a very powerful way to reorient your thinking about what constitutes rational choice and behavior.",https://uk.bookshop.org/books/micromotives-and-macrobehavior/9780393329469,"book, rationality, game-theory"
176,Hearing The Other Side by Diana Mutz,Jason Brennan,"I think you'll learn a tremendous amount about political behavior and how people think about politics. One other interesting fact about it, she asked the question, ""Who actually hears the other point of view? Who actually hears points of view with whom they disagree?"" It turns out that if you're white, rich, and educated, that predicts you almost never hear points of view with which you disagree, and if you are poor, not white, and uneducated, that predicts you frequently hear points of view with which you disagree.",https://uk.bookshop.org/books/hearing-the-other-side-deliberative-versus-participatory-democracy/9780521612289,"politics, book"
177,Reasons and Persons by Derek Parfit,Dylan Matthews,"A very technical and detailed read and might be tough for people without philosophy training. But it’s really rewarding, really eloquent on this kind of point. It builds up to an argument that our distance from other people is not as great as we might think. Our relationship with our future selves is like our relationship with other people existing with us at the same time. An implication of this is that selfishness makes a lot less sense than it might seem to, and altruism makes a lot more. That was a really influential and foundational book for me getting interested in philosophy and consequentialism.",https://uk.bookshop.org/books/reasons-and-persons/9780198249085,"book, philosophy, ethics"
180,Steady-State Economics by Herman Daly,David Roodman,Brought notions of economics but also thermodynamics to thinking about global environmental issues in a way that I found extremely compelling and helped me put me on the course that my life eventually followed.,https://uk.bookshop.org/books/steady-state-economics-second-edition-with-new-essays/9781559630719,"book, economics, environment"
181,"Anarchy, State, and Utopia by Robert Nozick",Will MacAskill,"It is an imperfect book in a lot of ways, but what the book does is really lay out the philosophical grounding for libertarianism, and what's known as right libertarianism as a theory of justice, which says that all there is to justice is that, ""Did you acquire your property in a way that was just? You didn't take it from anyone else,” and, ""Did you transfer it in a way that was just?"" I'm not a libertarian. I think it's incorrect. But I think it's very clear, and I think there are many very powerful arguments in that, and I think it's a moral view that at least we need to reckon with and take seriously.",https://uk.bookshop.org/books/anarchy-state-and-utopia/9780631197805,"politics, book"
188,Society of Mind by Marvin Minsky,Robert Kurzban,"I think that in the modern era people are talking so much about artificial intelligence that people have forgotten the good old fashioned artificial intelligence guys, and so part of what influenced me was Marvin Minsky's book, Society of Mind, which dates all the way back to the '80s. A smattering of applause. I think for people who don't just want to look at the cutting edge but want to take a look at some of the background work from someone who was trained in computer science which I think still has relevance today, I think that would be a very rewarding read.",https://archive.org/details/societyofmind00marv,"book, history, technology"
219,Grit by Angela Duckworth,Jason Collins,"There's some other people I could have named. James Heckman, or Caroll DeWitt. But really it's around this idea of: To what extent are there these other traits — in Duckworth's case, it's around grit — which affect success? So, how much do they really affect success? Then, in turn, how malleable are they? I'll probably have a couple of points, but I really grapple with her work around the question of how important is grit, really, towards success? Is it really just conscientiousness repackaged? Is there something genuine here? Similarly, to what extent can we change someone's grit through training? I suppose, looking through a lot of literature, I struggle to see the power of these interventions. But just her work in general challenges a lot of my pre-existing biases, partly coming from the evolutionary angle of some of my previous thinking, of how malleable are people? Can we really change them and their outcomes in a substantial way? Particularly through, I guess, smallish and costless interventions — can they really make a big difference?",https://uk.bookshop.org/books/grit-why-passion-and-resilience-are-the-secrets-to-success/9781785040207,"book, psychology"
221,"Famine, Affluence, and Morality by Peter Singer",Rob Reich,"Have helped to illuminate these important philosophical dimensions of charity and philanthropy under the heading “effective altruism.” I've learned an enormous amount from them, but at the end of the day I think the kind of consequentialist view that drives them makes it more difficult for us to attend to the political dimensions of philanthropy of the sort we've just been discussing.",https://web.archive.org/web/20210501111502/https://personal.lse.ac.uk/robert49/teaching/mm/articles/Singer_1972Famine.pdf,"article, alturism"

223,Heaven and Earth Are Not Humane by Franklin Perkins,Chris Fraser,"Frank is a professor of philosophy at the University of Hawaii.  A nice, fresh interesting route into the field that looks at a different sorts of doctrines. He's especially concerned with how something corresponding to the problem of evil is manifested and dealt with in early Chinese philosophy.",https://uk.bookshop.org/books/heaven-and-earth-are-not-humane-the-problem-of-evil-in-classical-chinese-philosophy/9780253011725,"book, history, philosophy"
241,On Human Conduct by Michael Oakeshott,Thibault Le Texier,"He has a very subtle and profound understanding of the functioning of society and politics. I recommend this book to everyone. Well, basically he sees human societies as organized around two main forms. One he calls “universitas”and one he calls “sociatus.” The universitas is a managerial society where everything is organized, that people are under control and the behaviors are controlled by a main authority. And in a sociatus, it's more like the society is ruled by law. It’s like you are drawing white lines on the floor. People cannot cross these lines. But within these lines they are free to do whatever they want. He [argues] that in whole societies there's a conflict between these two ways of organizing life. And that sometimes we live more in universitas, and sometimes more in sociatus. And it's a very stimulating way of thinking.",https://uk.bookshop.org/books/on-human-conduct/9780198277583,"philosophy, book"
