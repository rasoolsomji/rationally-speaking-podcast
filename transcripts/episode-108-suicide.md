**Massimo**: Welcome to Rationally Speaking, the podcast where we explore the borderlands between reason and nonsense. I'm your host, Massimo Pigliucci. And with me, as always, is my co-host Julia Galef. So Julia, what are we going to talk about today?
 
**Julia**: Well, Massimo, this episode is going to come out substantially after the holidays have ended, Christmas will be over, New Year's will be over and we will all start settling into the sort of dreary stretch of several months. Yet we have no festive holidays to cheer us up. So we figured this is the perfect time to lift everyone's spirits with an episode about suicide.

**Massimo**: Okay.

**Julia**: So we'll talk about the philosophy and the science of suicide during this episode. I guess I'll kick things off by just saying that I had read a little bit of philosophical treatises on suicide, and I returned to some of them again while preparing with this episode, and I have to say I'm pretty shocked at how many, in my view, terrible arguments there are from philosophers against suicide.

For example, Hobbs felt that suicide violated natural law. And was therefore immoral. He wasn't alone. Kant felt that suicide was - if you commit suicide, you're sinking lower than the beasts. And if someone survives a suicide attempt, they've discarded their humanity and we could just treat them is an animal. Other philosophers have said that it's immoral because you're shirking your duty to society.

I found these arguments appalling, and the idea that anyone would prevent me from exercising my right to suicide is is pretty scary.

**Massimo**: Wait a minute. What are you a libertarian or something ?

**Julia**: I think this issue a little bit.

**Massimo**: I know what you mean. And it's kind of interesting, however, that I'm gonna actually try to defend somewhat, or at least explain some of those arguments. I think we need to be more charitable. We'll talk about the details in a minute, but you need more charitable because first of all, of course, some of these positions are a reflection of a particular historical period and/or sort of ideological position. Right so, for instance, the most obvious one being the Christian arguments against suicide, Right? Well, if you believe in God. And if you do believe that you know that life is a gift from God and only God has the right to take it, then absolutely. Obviously suicide becomes a horrible thing to do. And that is a good argument-

**Julia**: -Given the premises precisely. So I wasn't shocked.

**Massimo**: So it's sometimes it's a matter. I don't think, for instance, that Kant was making necessary a better argument. I think he was starting from bad premises, however, which course it's amounts to the same in the end, but there's an interesting difference there, but I tend to actually share your sort of libertarian quote unquote position on suicide. It is, this is you can quote me, and this is one of the few cases in my philosophical sort of thinking where I actually share a libertarian position of any kind. But I'm interesting in sort of exploring some of the other positions and why. And of course, on top of which there are actually significant interesting arguments against the Libertarian position as well. So this is going to be fun, but so to speak, given the topic that we're having.

The first thing I think to understand, is that this is a very important topic. First of all, it's inherently interdisciplinary, right? I mean, we're talking about people who study suicide range from sociologist, anthropologist, a psychologist, psychiatrist, neuroscientists and, of course, philosophers. So it's  a huge field base, actually, such a thing as the American Society of Suicidology. I don't even know how to pronounce Suicidology. So the study of suicides on you know, in terms of numbers were talking also fairly big.

First of all, suicide rates have increased over the past 50 years in Western societies, in which, and nobody really knows exactly why. They're a couple of theories out there. And this is despite, of course, more attempts at prevention. You know, that sort of stuff. In terms just of sheer numbers, we're talking about about one million people taking their lives annually. That's about one every 14 minutes in the US, which means that by the end of these podcast, there will be three people at least on average, that were taking their lives for whatever reason. So this is actually serious. It's a serious. It's a serious issue.

It also seems like one of the interesting things, and I actually wonder what you think about this, before we get into a little bit of a brief philosophical issue of suicide. But perhaps counterintuitively, it's actually more difficult than most people think to actually define what counts a suicide. So for instance Hitler committed clearly committed suicide. I think we can agree on that right. He was surrounded by the Allies and took his life, and that counts pretty much a suicide. But what about, I don't know, Socrates or Jesus? They commit suicide? Because they got themselves into courses of action that led clearly to their deaths. And their deaths, in especially in the case of Socrates, was actually self delivered. So he was even the causal agent for it. So does that count as suicide?

**Julia**: It's kind of funny. I thought you were going to go in a totally different direction with me when you first made that statement. My first reaction was, huh, seems clear cut to me, and then my next thought was "Well, actually, if you're at the end of your life and there are things you should be doing to stay alive and you don't do those things to that count of suicide?" And I think there's a spectrum there as well in terms of how actively you try to prolong her life or try to not prolong it.

**Massimo**: And in fact, there are cases that I think many people would consider essentially suicide. But where the individual is not even the causal agent of death. The classic example, there is the so called "suicide by cop" when somebody provokes a policeman to shoot him. So it's kind of interesting that you started thinking about this thing. It's not even clear where exactly to draw the line. It turns out that actually many philosophers these days agreed that suicide is it yet another example of a family resemblance concept that is one of these concept that is like the concert of 'game' that has a core that is somewhat easy to identify. But there is a bunch of other, there's a bunch of parameters that enter into it, a bunch of threads and not all examples instantiations of the concept actually satisfy all the conditions. You know all the threads. So it's it's kind of interesting.

**Julia**: Which is awfully common once you start really trying to define

**Massimo**: But of course, in this case, it has very practical consequences. Right, Because we judge people in a certain way positive or negative or whatever. We have value judgements about suicide. We have programmes aimed at the prevention of suicides. We have laws about the consequences of, for instance, physician-assisted suicide. So it turns out this is one of those cases were having a better understanding of the concept, which is typically what philosophers start to do actually has directly obvious sort of practical consequences for the whole thing. So anyway, so let me give you just a very, very brief history, as I see it of the concept of suicide in philosophy. So first of all, the first thing we know about it, in terms of actual writing in the Western tradition, is goes back. You guessed it, to Plato.

**Julia**: I did in fact guess it, those who were wondering.

**Massimo**: All philosophy is a footnote to Plato and so on. Now Plato actually writes about the suicides in two places in the Phaedo and in the Laws. The Laws is the more the more interesting treatment where he says that suicide is a bad thing. It's immoral except under four conditions, when one's mind is morally corrupted beyond the possibility of redemption. But that's interesting when it is done because of judicial order. In the case of Socrates, for instance, so played are considered Socrates example one of suicide, when compelled by extreme and unavoidable misfortune. Which would be something that, for instance, would cover modern assistant physician assisted suicide, and then four as a result of shame for having carried out more immoral actions.

**Julia**: Do you know what he meant by unavoidable misfortune? Like if I was just a stupid head and got myself into a bad situation that made me miserable am I then not allowed to commit suicide, according to Plato, because it wasn't unavoidable? Or did he mean unescapable?

**Massimo**: I think he meant inescapable. No, not foreseeable. Now Aristotle, who was Plato's student thought that suicide was wrong because it's, actually, he had a complex view. It was wrong towards society or the state because he thought that individuals have a duty of up to a point towards society and the state. Basically, it's a duty of reciprocity. Some other philosophers also argued that some some Contractarians. People that think, think of society in terms of social contract. But Aristotle thought it wasn't wrong to oneself because it's a consensual act. So you decide, you know, and that therefore you're doing of wrong to society. Arguably but not a wrong to yourself, which is kind of an interesting concept. So you were saying something?

Julia; Yeah, I remember reading that argument from him, and I felt like it was a little bit of a false reason or false justification and the reason that I suspected that is, although correct me if I'm wrong. I don't think that he argues that becoming a hermit is immoral because you're shirking your duties to society in some way. And it seems like the effect on society of suicide versus becoming hermit would be the same.

**Massimo**: That's an interesting observation. I don't know what Aristotle might have thought actually about hermits, but you're right. It's to be coherent, he would actually have a moral objection to hermits. Which, by the way, I do on similar grounds.

**Julia**: You do?

**Massimo**: Yeah, yeah. Because I am a virtual ethicist so I do think that there is a relation, that it's important in a eudemonic life, a good life between society and individual. I do think that if you choose to be a hermit, you are essentially abandoning the rest of society. Therefore, whatever moral duties you have to society and therefore you cannot possibly have a eudemonic life. Now that doesn't mean that I would put hermits in jail. I'm not suggesting to prosecute hermits. But I do think that there's something morally problematic about human being withdrawing from from society and by morally problematic, I mean, not just what we owe to other people, like our family, our friends, and so on and so forth. But even actually about the possibility of pursuing eudemonic life in isolation. We are social beings. So I just don't believe that that is actually possible-

**Julia**: -In general, were social beings. But if there are a few beings who are much happier and feel more at peace with the world and more personally fulfilled by being isolated, then it's hard for me to see how I could call them immoral. I might say, I think they're wrong and they would just be happier if they could interact in society, and they don't realise that yet. But that seems like a different claims, saying that they're immoral. This's totally another discussion-

**Massimo**: -But actually that's an important point because for Aristotle, those two claims amount to the same-

**Julia**: -I just think he's using words in a weird way.

**Massimo**: Well, we can continue that discussions at some point. Now the first departure from the ancient sort of philosophy of suicides towards a direction that is much more akin to what I assume many people, including probably the two of us. But we'll find out by the end of the episode, think about suicide. It comes with the Stoics.

So for the Stoics, suicide is permissible whenever we're, in fact, it's morally not only permissible, but sometimes even required, whenever we're impeded from pursuing a eudemonic life. And so, according to Seneca, for instance, who famously committed did commit suicide although in that case, that was under duress from the Emperor Nero. "A wise person lives", and this is a quote "as long as he ought, not as long as you can".

So this is an issue of quality of life. We will say in modern terms, right? So, for instance, all modern instances of people who seek euthanasia or assistance in suicide because they're terminally ill, that sort of stuff, Then those would definitely fall under the Stoics' purview of the way of looking at suicide and in fact, the libertarian position you were talking about earlier that I think we'll be going back to in a few minutes, actually can be traced back philosophically to Stoicism. The Stoics were the first ones to sort of propose something very much similar to what we today think of the libertarian position on suicide.

Now, if we could, you know, we're really brief, you know, sort of very quick history. And again, I definitely want to hear your thoughts about any or all of these things, as I'm going through. Now we get to the Christian period. We're leaving the ancient Greeks and Romans and we're going to the Christian Period. And there we have Augustine and Aquinas as the two giants of mediaeval philosophy.

Now, Augustine thought the preventing(?) suicide is an extension of the Fifth Commandment which, of course is, you know is "thou shall not kill". So It makes again, you know, you can argue. And I would definitely agree that that Augustine was starting from the wrong premise because premise there was God has given us commandments. But if you do start from that premise, it does actually logically follow that. That suicide is in fact may reasonably fall under that commandment. Although the commandment itself is not is not explicitly self referential, right?

**Julia**: Right I mean, there's this problem with all commandments, all laws, in fact, that there's just so many different ways to define things. And it's hard to know exactly what the original intent was, but its least plausible that thou shalt not kill was meant, you know, to refer to other people oneself is kind of a very special case that you think would have have to be sighted explicitly rather than just left as part of the killing in general if it were meant to be prohibited. But anyway, yeah, wrong premises.

**Massimo**: Now Aquinas was significantly more sophisticated I think. And he is the first Christian thinker that really does go in details through arguments about about suicides and is against suicide for three reasons. He says. It is country to natural self love. OK, so in other words, what we will call the instinct for preservation. And so basically there was. It was making a naturalistic argument right, which were course today after Hume, we would reject, but at the time, naturalistic arguments remember, we're also typical theologically based, right? I mean, natural law really meant God's law.

**Julia**: It does make sense. If you think that the way things are is the way God intended them to be, then so called naturalistic fallacy really isn't a fallacy.

**Massimo**: Exactly. It's not. So that was Aquinas' first argument. The second one was that injures the community. This one essentially is the Aristotlean(?) argument again as well. In fact, Aquinas has famously built a lot of his philosophy on Aristotle, and then the third one is it is a rejection of God's gift of life and particular of course His right to take it back at His discretion. So basically, you're sort of undercutting God by deciding on your own.

Again, I would assume that the two of us reject those kind of arguments. But at the time, those actually made perfect sense. And in fact, they still make perfect sense for billions of people to them. And we have to remember that although we tend to think of in terms of a sort of secular society, billions of people around the world actually would perfectly well feel comfortable with a Aquinas' arguments.

Next, the first critic of the Christian tradition on you may have guessed is as well is David Hume. Hume wrote a very, very sophisticated, very, very interesting essay on suicide, which I think, if we remember, well link to it from the from the podcast website.

**Julia**: Which I should mention he published after his death. That's right. You don't want it coming out during his lifetime.

**Massimo**: Yes, that one and his dialogues on religion, he didn't feel comfortable enough. Yes, he was a smart guy, now, so he actually criticised the mystic position. That is the position of Thomas Aquinas, and he raised several interesting points. I mean, I'm not going to go through all of these arguments, but the bottom line are first of all, he argued that God allows us to act counter to natural laws in some cases, for instance, when we fight disease. So why not others? So this was, if you think about it, is an interesting It's a clever argument. It's like wait a minute. How do you / where you draw the line, non-arbitrarily between what kind of action against natural laws we're allowed or not allowed to do, right? I mean, if it's okay to fight a disease, which you can argue is part of natural law then, why not commit suicide or somehow, flaunt natural laws in other situations?

**Julia**: I love Hume, and I like this argument, but I would have been so afraid to make it for fear that the response from the Christian philosophy community would be, I guess you're right. We shouldn't allow people to try to have overcome disease and I wouldn't put it past them.

**Massimo**: No, and in fact, there are some extreme Christian sects even today, that actually do make that argument. The Christian, the very oxymoronically named Christian scientists, for instance, do think that you know disease needs to be fought only by prayer in faith and not actually medicine, because that's pretty much the argument. At least one can give them the logical coherence. You know, they really believe in natural law, as wanted by God, and they're willing to literally die to be in order to be coherent.

Now, the second argument Hume had was concerned again obligations to society. So this is a response to Aristotle, if you will, as well as Aquinas. He says well, if if your conditions are dire, you may actually be more of a burden to society than a benefit. So that at any rate the contract of society is, of course, like all contracts are conditional under certain circumstances they're valid. But there may be circumstances under which the social contract doesn't hold. If society, for instance doesn't give me, and this is a modern argument as well, if society doesn't give me somehow you know the way that the means to actually have a eudemonic good, healthy life and all that. Then society itself actually has failed me, and it has failed the contract. So why should I? You know, hold up my part of the bargain, basically.

And then finally says, in terms of duty to ourselves, which was the other argument that goes back to Aquinas at least, if our living conditions are dire against suicide actually helps us. And it is therefore, the rational thing to do. Again, this this would be an argument in favour of euthanasia for terminally ill patients and that sort of stuff.

**Julia**: Although I think he was pretty adamant that, not that it was immoral to commit suicide without considering your other options, but that it was stupid if I'm remembering correctly.

**Massimo**: That was actually, so the issue of rationality or stupidity or lack of rationality actually was underpinning Kant's response and Kant famously in a lot of his philosophy, responded or reacted to Hume, Kant famously said that he was writing his books as a response to Hume because Hume woke him from his slumber. Basically and though, even though Kant disagreed with most of his position, he thought that Hume was by far the best presenter the most cogent presenter of certain ideas and then, therefore sort of stimulated Kant to respond.

Now on suicide specifically, Kant argued that suicide is an attack on the very same Will from which moral authority stems and therefore it's an attack on morality itself. So, in other words, he was making this kind of logical argument. That moral authority stems from the fact that you're a person, that you're a rational person. So to ask whether suicide is moral or not. It's almost a contradiction because you're asking whether the source of morality is moral. Okay, like I know it's an interesting argument, not that I buy it. I'm not saying that I buy, but it's kind of an interesting argument like, Well, if you think that morality comes from you, the moral law within us, a Kant famously put it, then what are you asking exactly when you're saying when you're asking whether suicide is moral because you're destroying your about to destroy the very source?

**Julia**: Well, but you haven't yet. I mean...I'm sorry. I don't even know how to engage with that argument. It's not even using terms I understand.

**Massimo**: Welcome to Kant's philosophy.

**Julia**: Well, I don't know, the analytic tradition, at least some not negligible subset of the analytic tradition will, at least talk in a language I understand about: "So this is the good that I value". Even if it's not an outcome, the way a utilitarian would, you know, would cite as a good. And they'll say, these are the things that reduce that good and that therefore I consider immoral. These were the things that increase it, and I consider it moral, like I can understand that language. But the idea of the locus of morality, being a person's free choice and an act being an attack on a locus, which is already an abstract concept, it's almost like he's just speaking symbolically. I don't know how to evaluate his argument.

**Massimo**: Well, I just wanted to put it out there because actually, that's often the reaction that I and a lot of other people have to Kant, but he's not easily dismissed. I mean, yes, you're right. You have to buy into certain language and think about it, how you respond to that argument within that language. And I think there are actually good responses to the Kantian position. But you brought up a couple of times already sort of the modern position. So why don't we get into the jump into the modern stuff?

So the modern stuff. One, there's the deontological argument, which essentially would be similar to a Kantian argument for the sanctity of life. Now, when we hear the word sanctity of life, of course we think about religious argument in religious position. But actually secular people, several secular humanists have also argued for the what would they would refer to as the inherent value of life. There's life is valuable in and of itself and therefore any attack on life may be none justified, and you know, I don't actually buy that position, but the point is you don't need to be a religious person to think along those lines.

There are good objections, however, to that. First of all, there's an objection of coherence. Okay, if you think that life is inherently valuable, then you got also problems with capital punishment and even in fact, with death caused by self defence, acts of self defence. I mean, where are you drawing the line. How what valuable, inherently valuable life is if it can't be the ultimate good, because otherwise are lots of other things that the same people might agree are ethical/moral. They turn out not to be right?

**Julia**: This is the problem that I have whenever someone says, "Well, such and such is just an inherent good". They're not claiming it is an empirical fact that people value it. They're claiming it is inherently valuable. And, I just don't see how you could defend for example, life is inherently valuable over other, in my mind, you know, equally indispensable propositions like free choice is inherently valuable or complexity is inherently valuable. Or simplicity is inherently valuable or any. Like, how do you make the argument that one of those is true? And one of them is not without just saying, Well, other people agree with me.

**Massimo**: You're absolutely right, in fact, that the typical objection to this kind of argument is that it isn't that life isn't inherently valuable. Whatever that means.  It is that life is valuable because it has a certain quality, right? So you want to be alive because you can do certain things you can. You can pursue your projects. You can enjoy pleasures. You have relationships and so on and so forth. Which means and that's what makes life valuable to a human being, at least. And therefore, if you lose all of those things or most of those things you may get to the judgement that it's not worth pursuing life, your life project any any longer. So, I think that you're right, that whenever somebody invokes, inherent this or that, what they really means is that's what I feel and end of story. It's not really an argument.

**Julia**: I had a philosopher once tell me that cooking was inherently a low value activity was I like, Do you mean you don't enjoy it? And she said no, it's inherently low value. She's like I haven't proven it yet, but I will prove it someday. I asked her if she was kidding many times, and she swore she wasn't.

**Massimo**: Well when when she manages to prove it, why don't we have her on the podcast and see what comes up. Now, why don't we talk about briefly but the libertarian position, which we both seem to be sympathetic towards. But there are actually some objections to that one, too.

As I said earlier, Libertarian position has the historical precedence that go all the way back to Stoicism. So the basic idea is that the individual has a right to suicide and that state or medical interventions amount essentially to coercion. Now they're actually different kinds, different sort of variations of the libertarian positions. It's not clear which right, particularly one may be referring to. But I'm going to talk about the very same basic, the basic idea. 

So the basic idea seems to be rooted in the concept that we own our bodies and, you know, just like we own other things. And since it's my body, I can do whatever the hell I want with it right now. There are some interesting objections there, which you may or may not buy, I'm curious to see what your thoughts are.

One is that the claim to self ownership, meaning ownership of your own body, is actually metaphysically dubious, it's a little murky. Why? Well, because think about what it means to own other things, right? So I own a really cool looking yellow watch, which I'm wearing right now. Well, I can say that I'm owning the watch precisely because the watch is a distinct object from myself so I can sell it, for instance. Or, I can throw it away, but it seems like it's a little more difficult from a logical perspective to make the same claim about my body. I don't own my body. I am my body, which again metaphysically is a very different thing. I cannot really sell my body. I can use my body to get money. For instance, I can sort of do that sort of stuff, but I cannot literally sell my body in the same way in which I can sell my watch. So that's one kind of objection to the libertarian position.

**Julia**: I just feel like that talk about ownership and even the talk about rights is kind of missing the point. Like my starting point the most natural, logical starting point from my perspective would be: You need a reason to prevent me from doing something. And especially something that I care passionately about, like having an escape hatch from life at my disposal. If someone doesn't have a good reason from preventing me from exercising that hatch, then it's immoral to prevent me from from using it.

**Massimo**: I can see that. But again, that has to be grounded in something. And I wasn't necessarily reacting to your specific position. As you just explained it. I was just talking about the general the libertarian, typical libertarian defence, which typically is rooted in the concept of rights and self ownership.

**Julia**: I guess I don't really share their their framework. You end up at similar conclusions because yes, all I'm saying is I don't think the onus is on us to defend why we should be allowed to kill ourselves. I think the onus is on other people to defend why they should be allowed to stop us.

**Massimo**: Yeah, well, let's get to that in a few minutes because I want to finish exploring the classic Libertarian position, which is so first of all the objection that I just brought up to self ownership seems to indicate that the concept of ownership of one's body it's actually more of a metaphor than the basis for an argument. In a metaphorical sense, I own my body, but not in the same way in which I own my watch.

And the additional problem here is that even if we actually buy into the metaphor, well, there are all sorts of objects that we cannot dispose as we please, because the disposing of those objects actually has consequences on other people. Like so, for instance, if I own a poisonous gas, I can't just dump into the East River because I want to get rid of it. There are rules and regulations about that sort of stuff because my actions are going to affect other people's lives right.

So one could make the equal similar argument that even if I buy into the idea that you own your body, by destroying your body, you actually are affecting a bunch of other people toward which you may have a certain degree of moral responsibility, and therefore there is an issue there. Now how far you want to push that argument it's a different matter. Meaning, does that mean that I should be forced not to commit suicide? That I don't know. But the point is that it sort of begins to erode a little bit. What too many people, I think, think of as the almost self evident libertarian position. Yes, of course, I own my body. Well, actually, you know, it's not quite that clear that what that means and what follows from from that.

**Julia**: Yes, and I am pretty sympathetic to that. I mean, it's a utilitarian argument, basically. Well, I suppose you could make it in a utilitarian way. Not that you have an obligation or duty to society in some abstract sense, but that your choice has consequences for other people who will suffer. And, you know, I think this is one area in which I might depart from utilitarianism a little bit in that, even if you can do more good on net by continuing to exist and suffer, I would still not fault someone for killing themselves to relieve their suffering. Even if the net effect was worse because of the other people around them who suffered somehow just the idea of someone being trapped because of their obligations to other people is scary enough to me that I'm willing to flout utilitarianism in this instance.

**Massimo**: Well, yeah, but you know, I can see the point. On the other hand, as you just pointed out, that is in fact abandoning utilitarianism. So which means that the utilitarian position is itself not quite that that airtight. Not only that, but actually you can interestingly, you, can turn around the utilitarian position, depending on, we had Peter Singer recently on the podcast, who is arguably the most famous utilitarian alive today. And even he explained that there are actually different versions of utilitarianism, one of which is so called act utilitarianism, as opposed to rule utilitarianism.

So utilitarianism based on the consequences of individual actions as opposed to the consequences of general rules right. Now, an act utilitarian may actually make an argument that suicide in certain conditions is not only permissible, but valuable and even morally obligatory. So let me give you a couple of examples. You know the typical situation is the soldier who jumped on the grenade that it's about to explode in to save his comrades. I think that was one of the initial scenes in the first Captain America movie, for instance, or committing suicide for political reasons to make to make a political statement that leads to social change.You can imagine bunch of these situations where if not quite obligatory, it's certainly morally praiseworthy committing suicide. It's actually morally praiseworthy that's a utilitarian argument because, you know, in the case, it's a straightforward, utilitarian argument because you're sacrificing yourself for the benefit of you know a certain number of people in the case of the soldier who jumps on the grenade or a very, very large number of people in the case of somebody who starts social movement.

**Julia**: But there are utilitarian arguments for suicide as well along those lines, but just much more broadly that each human being takes a toll on the planet and its resources, and you could maybe argue, you know, causes suffering in Third World countries because of what's required to produce the goods that American society runs on et cetera and so by killing yourself, you're removing a little bit of that burden on the world. But I feel like if that's your motivation, what you should be doing instead is devoting your life to figure out a way to fix these problems. It's hard to defend suicide instead of the activism or researcher, whatever other paths.

**Massimo**: I would agree. Now we also want to talk a little bit about the science of suicide, and the two are very much intertwined. This is one of those areas where you really can't do science without really thinking about the philosophical underpinning of things and vice versa. You really cannot advance philosophical arguments beyond a certain point unless you actually pay attention to the facts.

So, for instance, let me ask you a question about what you were saying earlier. Essentially, we agreed that two of us tend to have, although probably for different reasons, somewhat libertarian attitudes towards suicide. But that is, I would assume, in the case of people who actually deliberately rationally think about what let's say the quality of their lives, the typical example again being euthanasia for terminally ill patients, and they decide to take their lives. But what about people who actually constitute the majority? I think of the people who commit suicide at this point who are in fact, you know, mentally ill. They're clinically depressed and all that, and they may actually be in a situation where they are not in the condition to make their best decisions for their own future life course. What do you think is the obligation, if any, of society in that case.

**Julia**: Yeah, it's a good question, and I've thought about it before. There's no simple or easy answer I think. And another thing to add actually to your nice summary, is that people who have attempted suicide and survived, like, for example, the small minority of jumpers off the Golden Gate Bridge who've lived to tell about it. Many, or maybe most them say that they regretted it the instant they stepped off the bridge. People will say, for example, you know, as soon as I as soon as my feet left the ledge, suddenly all my problems in life seem resolvable, and I was filled with anguish about why I have chosen this path when there are other options. So that does indicate that by preventing people from killing themselves, even people who you know aren't senile or demented or in theory have all their mental faculties, we could actually be acting in their own interest, like in the sense that they would agree that we were acting in their interests. You know, a day later, something.

**Massimo**: Right and so typically philosophers make a distinction there in terms of interventions to suicide in two major categories. So on one hand, it seems, morally unproblematic to say that you can intervene by trying to talk somebody out of it. Okay, so if I just talked, if I see somebody in the Golden Bridge about to jump and I just talked to him and I tried to convince him that it is a bad idea there doesn't seem to be any particular moral problem in doing that because I'm not coercing anything you know I'm simply presenting an argument essentially to try to convince him, to persuade him.

But the real sort of difficult moral issue comes with so called paternalistic interventions right where it's the family or the state that come in and restrain or medical petitions(?) that restrain the ability off somebody to commit suicide because their judgement is that this person is not in his literally in his right mind, meaning that he's not capable of rational consideration off his own situation.

Now it seems to me I actually think that there are situations and the examples that you brought up from survivors of the Golden Bridge jumping seems to sort of [support] this that there are in fact good, morally good reasons to trying to intervene, even in a coercive way under those circumstances. There it seems to me that the libertarian position is at its weakest point. What do you think? You wouldn't argue libertarian all the way?

**Julia**: No definitely not. I was saying, it's hard to come up with a hard and fast rule, but they're certainly factors that should make you more inclined. To assist a suicide or not stand in the way of suicide and factors that should make you less inclined to assist a suicide like you know. Is it in fact, true that this person's disease is well nigh incurable, and they're clearly suffering? Do they display other signs of psychosis or other kind of mental illness, etcetera. So some, like, weighted combination of those factors is just the best we have in terms of making these judgement calls, and there's many, many cases in the grey area.

But I guess the way in which I diverged from sort of the standard way of thinking about this is that I don't really think... I think the standard way of thinking about this is that you err on the side of safety. You err on the side of keeping someone alive. You need pretty strong reasons to allow them or to kill themselves or to help them kill themselves. And maybe because I'm so focused, my morality is so focused on suffering and preventing and alleviating suffering that it seems to me that, you know, for example, someone who's paralysed or in like a locked in syndrome kind of state that really does seem worse than death to me. And so even if you don't know for sure what their will is or even if you don't know for sure just how badly they're suffering. Erring on the safe side to me sometimes means erring on the side of pulling the plug.

**Massimo**: Yeah, well, I can see the reasoning. I mean, I know that there are situations where that could be very controversial because, for instance, there is some evidence that even locked in patients when they can communicate in very, very interesting creative ways that sometimes are possible, they would actually tell you, well, at least some of them I shouldn't say they because there's variability between individuals, probably. But some of those people will tell you that that life is precious even under those conditions. So you may be there is a danger they're projecting. Well, what would I do, projecting your own preferences, basically, under those conditions, I mean, I would agree with you. I don't think that life for me under those conditions would be worth living. But perhaps it is for other people, so it's really difficult to make that sort of judgement.

**Julia**:  And killing someone or allowing someone to kill themselves who in their right mind would have actually wanted to live is definitely a very serious wrong. I just think it's also a very serious wrong to force someone to continue to live when they're suffering horribly. And I think that that second thing is often neglected and people only consider the first wrong and how important it is to make sure you avoid that at all costs.

**Massimo**: I agree. Now there is also, of course, research on the more mechanistic aspect of the will to suicide. Like, for instance, of a couple of years ago, I think geneticists discovered a gene called RGS2, which, it turns out, to code for a brain receptor. That gene appears, for instance, more frequently in families with high rates of suicide.

And so that seems to indicate that there may be some some kind of genetic underpinning now, as you know, I'm very cautious about these kind of things. I never used the word genetic cause or genetic determination, because genes are one of many causes of what we do. And just because suicide rates are high in certain families, for instance, the Wittgenstein family, if you were talking about philosophers, that doesn't mean that there is something genetic. I mean, it could be a family environment so also confounded in that case because they tend to have similar environments. But there seems to be some interesting suggestions that in particular not only brain receptors, but particular serotonin related receptors and serotonin is known to affect mood you know it's involved in cases of depression, for instance.

So the neurobiology and genetics of it is interesting as well. People, for instance, who commits suicide tend to have a higher probability of damage in the prefrontal cortex. And in particularly in the areas that affect production of serotonin. So you know, there may be some biological basis to this tendency(?) and, of course, the same, as we all know, the same biological substrate reacts differently to different environmental conditions. But still, actually, that would be in my mind in argument in favour of some level of intervention, right? I mean, if you have, if you tend to have a sort of a gene or a neurotransmitter that is malfunctioning, then you're definitely not making the decision to commit suicide as a rational decision, considering your actual situation in life and everything. It just may be that there's something that is literally not working quite right in your brain. And in which case, you need help, You need some kind of chemical that, for instance, counterbalances the serotonin uptake. That sort of stuff, right?

**Julia**: Right. Yeah, I guess I basically agree. Yeah, I feel confused in general. about what the line is between someone's psychology being an outlier and someone's psychology being broken. And therefore we should conclude they're not actually in possession of free will.

**Massimo**: No, I agree that there is definitely extremes, as you were describing the minute ago are clear. But when you get in the middle, there's a lot of murky stuff there. And speaking of murky stuff, I think we're almost next to the end. But I wanted to bring up another point, which was actually bring brought up by an article that I read by Ben Goldacre, another one of our former guests, we now start having a number of guests and I can actually start citing a lot of them. I keep running into their articles or books, but anyway, Goldacre wrote a really interesting article about the media responsibility when it comes to suicide, because course suicides are very newsworthy, especially if it's a celebrity that commits suicide. Sometimes they're sort of front page news.

And first of all, there are studies that show that suicides go up in frequency after a suicide is being covered in the front pages of newspaper. Not only that, but the method used for suicide over several months after a new story tends to be more frequently associated with the methods covered by this story. So that means that of course, there's some you know, you know you don't want to infringe. I mean, there's a whole discussion here about the freedom of the press to report on things and the interests of the public, as in these things.

But that means that, Goldacre argues that that means that these two things. First of all, the people should be very careful about, journalists should be very careful about how you take cover suicide, and second that they could at the very least, use articles like that also to remind people that hey you know by the way there are ways to help people in those conditions. There are prevention programmes in other words provide some kind of positive information, not just cover the gory story. The most horrible example that I've heard of is, in fact, from Goldacre's article. And it refers to a Daily Telegraph headline that read "Men cut off own head with chainsaw", which, of course, is horrific enough. But the really horrific staff, according to Goldacre, was that inside the article, the Telegraph actually published a comprehensive, explicitly and detailed instruction manual of how to do it.

**Julia**: What? What? That's hard to believe. Are you sure?

**Massimo**: Yes, I am, I double checked. In fact, the Guardian refused. The Guardian for which Goldacre wrote the article actually refused to reprint basically to quote, the article from the Telegraph precisely not to read(?) the whole thing. That seems to me like an obvious example where the journalist has crossed the line. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever in my mind to give that sort of instruction manual just because this thing is newsworthy.

**Julia**: I would agree, and I would also include romanticising suicide or the dead person in any kind of way in that category, of like, you crossed outside of the need to know, let's get the facts out there, justification.

**Massimo**: And you know when the first time that that happened in recorded history, at least in the Western canon, was when Goethe published The Sorrows of Young Werther, an apparently that there was an uptick, significant uptick in suicides of young people throughout Europe who were going around dressed like the character of the novel and committed suicide. And so much so that the book was actually banned for a while because because of the number of suicides that indirectly generated.

**Julia**: The more things change, the more they stay the same. Well, we are actually over time now. That went by pretty quickly for such a gruesome subject. So unless you have any further objections, I will wrap up and move us along to the rational speaking picks.'

**Massimo**: Welcome back every episode, Julia and I pick a couple of our favourite books, movies, websites or whatever tickles our rational fancy. Let's start as usual with Julia's pick.

**Julia**: Thanks, Massimo. My pick is a blog. There aren't actually that many blogs that I read regularly, but I think this is one of the best out there. It's called SlateStarCodex and I can't explain why it's called that. But it's a blog by a soon-to-be doctor who is also just incredibly knowledgeable about incredible number of things. And a really, really excellent thinker. So he writes about philosophy and rationality and ethics and also about social and political issues. And he just has these incredibly well thought out, well researched essays basically about, for example, he has a very long and well cited critique of libertarianism, which I think you would like. And he also looks at well, one of his recent articles that I read for in preparation for this podcast was about assisted suicide in the medical profession and basically looking at both the ethics and the facts of how it is that so many people's lives are prolonged when basically no one in their right mind would want to live a life like that. And he can trace it back. He traced it back in the post to features of the system that contribute to this outcome. He's also got some great posts about pretty esoteric topics like Bayesianism as a mathematical system and also has a philosophy and a way of living anyway. Highly recommended SlateStarCodex.

**Massimo**: Very good so my pick is a book that I'm in the middle of reading, so I haven't finished yet. But it's so interesting that I think we may ask the author actually to come on the podcast if he's amenable to it. The book is Farewell to Reality: How Modern Physics has Betrayed the Search for Scientific Truth by Jim Bagot, who is now a science journalist. But he actually has a degree in physics, was a practising physicist, and you know, the book goes through some interesting sort of history of what he calls the authorised version of the view of the world according to physics. So the standard model and the search for the unified theory and all that.

And then he gets into the second part, gets into what he calls the grand delusion where he thinks physics has essentially abandoned or is about to abandon science as we know it. And it's getting into highly speculative and completely impossible to test notions, including things like string theory and parallel universes, multiverse and things like that. And it's an interesting critique because first of all, is written by physicist was written by somebody who actually knows what he's talking about. It gives you a very interesting insight into the way in which physicists conceptualise problems and way in which they move forward, their research. And then, of course, especially the second part it gets into, you know what I would call the philosophy of science. Although he doesn't use that term, up until what point are we still doing physics as opposed to something else? And what is the requirement in terms of being a science of the connection between theory and the empirical data and that sort of thing? Are we really looking at a major divergence in the history of physics is the first time he argues that physics has gone into that direction since at least Galileo. So it's a very interesting and I assume very controversial book, and maybe we'll have him on the podcast one of these days but right now I'm simply just suggesting the book again. The title is Farewell to Reality: How Modern Physics has Betrayed the Search for Scientific Truth by Jim Bagot.

**Julia**: That sounds awesome and putting it on my to read list as well. Well, this concludes another episode of rationally speaking. Join us next time for more explorations on the borderlands between reason and nonsense.
