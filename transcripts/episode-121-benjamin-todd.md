**Massimo**: Welcome to Rationally Speaking, the podcast where we explore the borderlands between reason and nonsense. I'm your host Massimo Pigliucci and with me as always, is my co-host Julia Galef. Julia, what are we going to talk about today?

**Julia**: Today we are pleased to welcome a special guest, Benjamin Todd. Ben is the co-founder and executive director of the nonprofit 80,000 Hours, which is  affiliated with Oxford and we're gonna talk about what they do on the show today. Ben graduated with honors from Oxford in physics and philosophy, and before founding 80,000 hours, before taking charge of 80,000 hours, he was the first undergraduate to intern as an analyst at a top investment fund and rather than taking the job that was offered him, he persuaded the chairman to donate Â£60,000 to 80,000 hours in their work. So clearly has powers of persuasion as well as as well as the general intellect. Ben, welcome to the show.

**Ben**: Hi, it's great to be here.

**Massimo**: Great to have you. So, Ben, 80,000 hours. That's the average length of a career, isn't it?

**Ben**: Yeah, it's just a rough figure for a kind of 40 times 50 times 50, typical working life. And the idea of the name is that it's a pretty long time but it's also finite. So it's really worth spending a bit of time thinking about how to use those hours to do something worthwhile.

**Julia**: And by worthwhile I can imagine many different things that could mean, how does 80,000 hours think about what's worthwhile?

**Ben**: Well, so we focus on helping people to make a difference with their careers and by make a difference, we just mean that very broadly, I mean in practical terms we think of it as basically solving important social problems and we want the end effect to be basically more people having better lives now and in the long run. We're not, I mean we're not committed to a particular view of exactly what's valuable, so, you know, some people will, this ultimately is a value judgment as to what counts as making a difference. And someone might differ in for instance, how much they weigh the interests of future generations compared to present generations, or how much they weigh the interests of animals with people. And we don't really take a stand on those kinds of things. We're interested anyone who's just broadly interested in solving important social problems, and then we'll make those value judgements kind of flag them and help people think it through based on like their own judgments, in fact factor that into that career plan.

**Massimo**: So it sounds to me like essentially a data driven philosophical project or something like along those lines. That is that is that an accurate way of putting it? Is that the way you think of of it?

**Ben**: Well, so we were all philosophers when we got started, So studying philosophy was definitely an inspiration for us, but you know, in terms of what we do day to day, it doesn't involve that much philosophy in the, you know, when it comes to working out how to make a difference, A lot of the topics that we actually spend most of our time thinking about don't directly involve the philosophical questions, so you know, questions like which job you're going to be good at, what, how to build useful skills, which ones are most useful, you know, like how to plan your career, what steps to take the main time the philosophical questions come up is in the question of which causes to support.

**Massimo**: But I would think also more more basic. I mean, before we get into the specifics of which causes and you guys have an interesting analysis of, you know, so different careers, uh, and their and their potential impact. And and I'd like to get into some detail about that. But but before we get even that far, I mean, it seems to me that the other philosophical component, of course is the foundation of the entire enterprise. It is you guys seem to assume that people at least some people, not, not everybody, probably, but some people are interesting in interested in pursuing what, uh, I would consider both almost a sort of you eudemonic life that is in life that has a moral component to it, uh, in a life that, that has meaning in a very specific sense of the term meaning. Does it? Is that not the case?

**Julia**: Sorry, to clarify, Massimo, you're talking about the effects that 80,000 hours wants to help people create in the world with their jobs or the motivation of the people coming to 80,000 hours pick a career?

**Massimo**: More the latter, more the motivation of the people. I mean, you have to have already a certain idea of what kind of life you want to you want to pursue if you're going to engage at all in this kind of project. Seems to me right.

**Ben**: Yeah. So I'd say you have to see making a difference as one of your, like significant life priorities. And I think that's something that a pretty significant fraction of, say graduate students, you know, people who've graduated in the last 10 years do share. And I would, I would say you don't need to think that's the only thing that matters in your career or even from a moral perspective, just that you think that that's one important priority among among couple. And then we really focus on helping you with that aspect of your life and, and like both from a moral point of view and in terms of your career as a whole.

**Julia**: So the process that I imagine most of our listeners are used to is someone who's graduating college or, you know, considering grad school decides they want to make a difference in the world. And there are a bunch of careers already that are sort of considered careers that help you do good in the world, like being a doctor or starting or joining a nonprofit, being an activist of some kind of being a social worker, being a teacher, is 80,000 hours directing people towards particularly good examples of those categories. Or does it have a different perspective on which categories these would be do gooders should be considering?

**Ben**: Yeah. So what, you know, we're trying to help people think about ultimately, what is the social impact of their career choices. So we're interested in any way in which you can have a social impact with your career. So that means we're both interested in the kind of the ones which you might call, like the ones that seem to the career paths that do good directly, like you're a doctor and you're helping people with your hands, or kind of broadly in the social sector or the public service sector, which are most often associated with ways to make a difference, but then you can also make a difference through many other career paths.

And if you think about, say, some of the most high impact or at least influential people of the 20th century, many of them were political leaders or they were researchers like Norman Borlaug's who started the Green Revolution or maybe they were business people like you might flag Bill Gates or someone both for bringing in the put the revolution, like the revolution in personal computing, but then also saving millions of children's lives through philanthropy.

**Massimo**: yeah, I haven't, I haven't forgiven Bill Gates for the first part part yet

**Julia**: So you also direct people towards careers that they might not have originally thought of as as doing good.

**Ben**: Yeah. And the, you know, the important thing is the impact you have. It's not the job title that you have, right?

**Julia**: That actually was my reaction to Massimo;s question just now about like the motivation of living eudemonic life, because it strikes me that one difference between the people who are attracted to 80K and, you know, feel free to correct me, Ben if you disagree with this. But  the way that they differ from sort of the standard pool of people who want to do good is that their more focused on just how how they're impacting the world, and less on what kind of life they're living. So if the result of their analysis suggests that the best way they can help the world is to earn a lot of money and donate it and never actually help someone directly, then that's what at least some of them are going to want to do, even if it doesn't feel as virtuous as working at a soup kitchen. Although you could redefine your eudemonia well, more utilitarian way, Right?

**Massimo**: But I wouldn't. so now you're right, that that's an important difference. And in fact, there are some interesting things that come out of from reading the materials at 80,000. One of the ones that jumped to my attention was the claim, which I assume is sort of evidence based. But the claim that, things like an activity like a profession like doctor being a doctor doesn't actually save many lives. While on the other hand, there are some kind of harmful industries that may even do some good. And so there's this kind of occasionally you find these, these, uh, counterintuitive claims and can you give us example of sort of maybe a harmful industry that may do some good or what people normally think of as a harmful industry?

**Ben**: Well, so I mean, this would this would come into the question of which causes you think are important, which we would more like try and help people think through for themselves rather than just say like this is our view of like is banking good or bad. like the claim that we've we have made is that sometimes, you might want to go into an industry that doesn't produce much good itself, You know, maybe it's neutral, in order to build skills or maybe to donate the money or maybe as like a way more generally to build your career capital, which can let you make a difference later. But we haven't kind of taking a stand on a kind of typical harmful industry and encourage people to to go into that.

**Julia**: What about the first part of that claim that being a doctor is not necessarily doing as much good as people feel like it is? How would you explain that well?

**Ben**: So doctors do, I mean, so in the case of doctors in particular, we had a doctor who's, who did a research project trying to estimate the health impact of additional doctors, in the UK, And he found that it was substantial. Something like saving one person's life for like, more accurately, 30 years of quality adjusted life per year, which is probably far more impact than most people have.

But then what was surprising is that if a doctor donates 10% of their income to a very effective charity they'll probably have a larger health impact than that. So the surprising claim more stems from how effective how surprisingly amazingly effective some of the most some of the international development charities are. Which means that the doctor might really counter intuitively be able to have more impact through their income than, through if they give it away, than through the work they do directly. At least in terms of medicines like the kind of people they will treat. I mean many doctors do medical research and you know work in public health and there's they might have a really outsized impact doing something like that but just in terms of like being a G.P. or something.

**Julia**: So it sounds like the principal I could extract from that point is that people should be looking at the marginal impact of their career choice. So conditional on or, not necessarily the marginal impact, but the impact of their their career relative to the impact of whoever would have had that job if they didn't.

**Ben**: Yeah so the I mean the social impact of you becoming a doctor depends on you know what happens because of you taking that job compared to what would have happened otherwise. So it's the marginal counterfactual impact. There's a couple of factors and one would be thinking of the margin and one would be thinking of thinking of counterfactual. I mean yeah with the case of doctors in particular part of it is because of there's some kind of elasticity there's already there's basically already a lot of doctors and there's a lot of people who want to be doctors. And so the impact of one extra person wanting to become a doctor isn't as big as you might think compare. And the impact of that is less than the impact of what you might do with your hands day to day. But then one of the other ways that it's surprisingly small health impact is just because actually medicine hasn't caused as much of the increase in lifespans, healthy lifespans. as you might think compared to sanitation and vaccinations and increasing wealth and things like that. That actually drives quite a lot of the estimates.

**Massimo**: Yeah, especially the sanitation, right? I mean that was really a major difference over the last century and a half or something like that. I have a question about, so you mentioned earlier the the concept of future generations and what we owed them or not or not? And in reading through your material, it seems to me that you're inclined to reject the Person Affecting view of how we should think of future generations, just like Derek Parfit who is one of the most influential philosophers who has written on that today. Can you, can you talk about that for a minute? So what is the Person Affecting view and what we really go to future generations? If anything.

**Ben**: I'm sure you'll probably be able to give a better summary of this debate than me. I mean, so I would I would flag again the I mean, we think it's plausible that you shouldn't put much weight on the Person Affecting view. So the Person Affecting view is the idea that what morally matters is helping specific, helping specific people rather than doing good in general. So therefore someone who's not alive yet, you don't like, you don't need to help them to, that's not part of what it can do, what you need to do in order to act morally. Whereas if you reject that view, you might think that then we do have obligations to help people who don't exist yet. Do you think is that a fact?

**Massimo**: I think that's the first summary. I would guess that most people, well, okay, since it's I guess I can going on and guess. I guess that most people would say that we do have a duty towards future generations. Would you would you disagree with?

**Ben**: I think that's the majority view, yes. So when we are helping people think about which causes to support, we present them a range of causes and some of them are much more important to support if you think that future generations are important and some of them are much more about helping present generations and what we would try and do is flag that as a big consideration and say, you know, if you do put if you do you think we have obligations towards future generations then consider more towards this range of causes. And if you're less inclined to that, more inclined to the Person Affecting view, then you'll probably be tilted more towards this range of causes in their importance.

**Julia**: And what is the range of causes or careers that that you point people towards? If they acknowledge their concern for future generations?

**Ben**: Yeah, so we we try we focused mainly on career research and we take the research into cause selection from a couple of sources one being Givewell and in particular their new project, Open Philanthropy Project. There's also the Copenhagen Consensus which is a panel of economists who rank different interventions for helping within international development. And also there's a project at Oxford called the Global Priorities Project, which is affiliated with the Future of Humanity Institutes, which kind of focuses on really big issues in what should the big priorities be in the next couple of centuries for for humanity. And so then we kind of collect that information and present it to correct(?) users.

And we find that among those groups, the people, if you're gonna wait, helping present generations more, than you'll probably be inclined towards, especially if you mainly focus on the kind of immediate welfare of those people, you're probably tilt towards global health and because there's all these cheap, proven, and surprisingly effective interventions like giving out malaria bed nets which really do a lot to save to improve people's lives in the present.

But if you're thinking more about building a like a strong and flourishing society that's going to do really well in the long run, then you might become more inclined towards thinking about scientific research, international institutions and cooperation, I suppose economic development in general.

**Julia**: Well, just to tie this thread into a thread from earlier in which you were talking about how medicine is a field is pretty saturated, so it's hard to have a large marginal counterfactual impact. When you're looking at the scientific fields that can have a significant effect on the wellbeing of future generations, I assume you want to take into account how popular those fields are, like how many people are actually working in those fields. And if so I'm curious which which of those fields of research you think could really use more people going in and doing research in them.

**Ben**: Yeah. So we encourage people to think about working on causes which are important, tractable, and neglected and the neglected part is the part that you are alluding to. Just because normally, if not many resources have been spent on the field than there's more low hanging fruits around, it's easier to make progress and you've got less competition. In terms of which fields most satisfy that there hasn't been that much research into that question. So at the minute it's it's pretty uncertain.

And I'd also say that within scientific research because there's such big divergences in the productivity of different scientists, the main thing you'll be thinking about when you go into becoming a researcher is what are your chances are really excelling and that's what's gonna drive your choice of field more than more than a like just kind of how promising is this field in general. So there aren't that many people for which that's the decisive consideration. 

But the there have been some cases, so one of the people we advised was a maths lecturer and was doing pure maths research and they switched into doing global priorities research, which is coming up with frameworks to use to prioritize big global problems and they reasoned that there's already a lot of like some of the world's smartest people are working on pure mathematics it's very competitive. It's been going on for hundreds of years. Many of the people in the field themselves don't think that they think that it's important, but maybe not the most important thing. Whereas with global something like global priorities research, that's a nascent field, he's going to be this person is helping to found the Global Priorities Project at Oxford and so there was really much more scope for someone with his skill set to you know, have a really exceptional, potentially exceptional achievement in that area compared to being another really really smart pure mathematician.

**Massimo**: So I'm wondering about a couple of things I guess first to comment on what you just said from from my own perspective as somebody was embarked into an academic career, scientific career initially, and then and then philosophy. It's interesting that I wasn't asking myself that sort of question I get maybe I should have. basically the question I was asking myself, you know, I was remember this this crucial period early on in my scientific career where I was looking for an area that would of biology in that particular case, that would interest me and more specifically of evolutionary biology. Because for whatever reason, I was already sort of leaning in that direction and I wasn't asking what I would be good at. I guess partly because I assumed that I would be good at it period. You know, I was an optimist and was 20 something. But the other thing that I was not asking myself is actually where I might have been able to make more, you know, more rapid progress or something. What I was really asking myself is what sort of thing tickles my bones what kind of, you know, what topic, what sort of area of research.

And I remember shopping around basically for a couple of years until I hit on the because of an article that I read because of a paper that I read ahead on these area of gene environment interactions. And and it sort of, it felt like, oh yeah, that's it, that's it clicked, and it clicked so well that for the next 20 plus years, that's what I did, you know, in different directions in various ways, but that's what I did. So it was interesting that that sort of analysis you're talking about was entirely missing from, from early on in my career, you know, maybe it should have been there. But that brings me to the actual question. Which is what kind of what's your typical user, what what kind of people do use 80,000?

**Ben**: Well, just yeah, just a quick thing on what you were saying. I think especially within research, the best one of the things that people most focus on in order to work out how good you're gonna be within the field. One thing you could think about is how interested I am I in this topic and everyone within research seems to think that's really, really important. So maybe like actually that is the most important question in terms of like working out your personal fit with an area. So and that and I mean that's kind of that's very much the advice that I think is is given around. And I think that actually makes quite a lot of that makes quite a lot of sense. So I think you kind of might have ended up having quite a good process even if you weren't thinking through explicitly, like why is this heuristic the one I should be following.

**Julia**: Although just to briefly interject, it seems to me That 80,000 hours can still have a lot of impact on people's choices, even holding to that principle just by causing people to include more fields within their set of consideration. Like if there are a bunch of fields that could do a lot of good in the world because they're neglected or high impact in other ways and you haven't even really been looking at those fields when you just ask yourself what subjects interest me, then just widening the set to include those is going to result in more people going into those fields, even if everyone is just using the heuristic, "pick the field that interests me the most".

**Ben**: Yeah, exactly, that's a good point. And and also I think people could mainly focus on interest, but we would encourage them to put some weight on other considerations like how uncrowded is this field. And you know the people we advise because they're very motivated by this social impact of their actions. They often find that that by focusing on thinking about like is this cause neglected or not, that's like part of what makes it interesting for them. So it kind of it feeds back and they end up becoming passionate about it even if they're not immediately focusing on the the interest of of the field just by itself.

Yeah the people the people who use 80,000 hours so we're it's mainly people in their twenties. They're mainly we appeal more to kind of people with an analytic background, so in philosophy, science, maths, those kinds of subjects. And I think that's partly because of the approach we take, which is quite a rational one. but it's also because of it's also because those people don't get they're not appeal to buy the existing kind of social sector as much. Because if you have like a mathematical skill set, it's hard to find a role for you in a charity or, you know, doctor or social worker. Whereas there are actually ways you can make a big difference in in research or in earning to give or in say technology or something like that.

**Julia**: What was that term you used Earning to Give? I mean, I know what it means, define it for our listeners.

Yeah, sure. So Earning to Give is the idea of taking a if your skill set is suited to a high earning career than taking the high-end career and donating a significant fraction of the income, typically the 30% or upwards towards effective charities.

**Julia**: So that was actually another question I wanted to ask you. I've heard, I think it was 80,000 hours advising people to follow an Earning to Give strategy, not everyone, but like suggesting this is an underappreciated strategy towards helping the world. and one concern that I've heard about anecdotally, and I don't know how representative this is, is that the day to day experience of, say, being a banker, can, if that wasn't particularly motivating to you in the first place, like you weren't just dying to become a banker, and just doing it so that you could donate as much money as possible, but it's just so hard to stay motivated in this very difficult career and that the burnout or the risk of burnout from pursuing and Earning to Give strategy might outweigh the absolute amount of money that you could theoretically donate if you stuck with it. So does have you heard about cases like that? And if so have they affected the advice that you give people?

**Ben**: Well, so that's always been something we've taken into account. So like we would say Earning to Give is a strategy to consider, but you know, it depends on how much. So one of the most important factors in a career decision is your degree of personal fits with the path, which is basically like how well will you do within the path? But you know, you consider things like how satisfying it is and you could factor in like if you're likely to burn out in the path, then that's a real that really down weights, how good it is from personal fit point of view. So we would like not, we would say in probably don't go and become a banker if you think that you would burn out from doing that. And in practice, the people who have pursued Earning to Give, where people who are maybe very interested in and high earning career anyway, but thought maybe there was there's no way for me to have the social impact that I'm interested in in this career. So they were wondering whether to go and do something else. 

Also, a lot of people have taken these, these jobs more for skill building, and keeping their options open rather than committing to this for the long run. So, you know, there's people who have done consulting for a few years and that was a very useful career step for them anyway, but they've now donated, you know, 20% of their earnings while they were doing that.

**Massimo**: So I'm guessing you're not getting a lot of inspiring poets to consult with. Right?

**Ben**: So we would say that because we're interested in all the ways that you can make a difference. We're interested in the earnings and also what we call the advocacy potential of different career paths that, you know, we would actually say if if that if you thought it was a good fit for you and, you know, this maybe it could be a platform or for spreading important ideas, or, you would, you know, it would be a way of building your career capital, then you should seriously consider that as a path which is actually broader than often are focusing careers that make a difference where you know it to be. Like poets don't make any immediate impact in terms of helping people directly, so you shouldn't become a poet. Whereas I think you should consider that because of the indirect potential for impact.

**Massimo**: But that brings us to the question which we kind of we sort of skirted around a couple times already about your definition of impact and making a difference. Right? I mean, there's some components of making a difference or having an impact that I read are controversial. I mean if somebody is in the business of saving lives like a doctor, you know what a medical research or whatever that seems, it seems fair and non controversial to say that that person has a positive impact. On the other hand, somebody you know, making biological chemical weapons, it probably is more likely to have a negative impact other things uh, considered.

But then there is a lot of stuff that doesn't quite follow fall quite that clearly in one or the other because essentially the kind of careers that we've been talking about or the kind of impact that we've been talking about at this point, up to this point, our fundamental utilitarian and and so they they seem to fall into a particular definition of what is a positive impact.

But human life, of course, is much broader and more complicated and more, in some sense, I would say, even more interesting than that. You know, my case of I brought up poets, uh, to be a little bit, uh, you know, they're on the extreme of that. But there's a bunch of other, uh, things that one can think of doing, because one has a passion that may or may not have an impact or it certainly may not have the kind of impact that you're talking about now those people would simply not be interested in in your services or is there a way you can you can actually more broadly accommodate you know, different definitions of what it means to have an impact or make a difference?

**Ben**: So in terms of accommodating it into our advice, the conception of what actually makes a difference only arises in the the cause selection component of which career to work on, Which is kind of maybe only like 20% of 10% of what it is to pick a career. So the rest is like for everyone, no matter what your moral, what your moral position is. What was the question you asked just before that?

**Massimo**: Well I was getting I was getting at the issue of the very word, the very term sort of concept, if you prefer, of having an impact seems to be in the case of 80,000 seems to be focus on a very specific way of making sense of that phrase. I mean, I would say, you know, for instance, again, going back to the poet, writer, poet might say, well, you know, Shakespeare made an impact, but you probably didn't save any lives and you know, that that sort of thing. 

**Ben**: Well, so I'd say we have focused, we tend to be thinking about something like helping more people have flourishing lives. And that would that could easily can include all kinds of ways of having a better quality of life as as well as saving lives. And that could include things like the appreciation of art. For sure. And then, I mean, and then, yeah, we focus on helping people with the impact side of their career decisions. But that's not to say that you might have other important moral considerations. say, you know, relating to things which aren't to do with impacts such as acting virtuously, or helping there be more of some kind of non welfare, non human flourishing value in the world, like the value of art for its own sake. And you could that would be for you to, you know, that's a that's a valid thing that you might want to factor into your career decision. Though it's not what we tend to focus on ourselves. 

And I guess on on this point, I would say that, I think the social impact of your actions is something that every moral position should care about quite significantly, particularly because in in our kind of quite counterintuitive modern economy where the effects of your actions can be very widespread and where you literally have the power to save people's lives with your money and you know, impact future generations. Because the differences between different actions in terms of social impacts can be quite significant. Often it's one of the most significant moral considerations when choosing between two actions.

So we kind of think like for practical purposes because your impact, because your different actions can have such large social impacts, that should be something that you should put a significant amount of weight on. Even if it's not the, you know, in principle, it's not the only thing that matters.

**Julia**: Ben, the problem that I often run into when talking about these topics with people is that the very idea of trying to be calculating and analytical and optimizing about the idea of doing good seems to rub a lot of people the wrong way-

**Massimo**: -especially the poets.

**Julia**: -I don't talk to a lot of poets to be honest, but I'm sure I would have a similar problem with them. I was reading this thread, I forget where, but anyway, people were discussing Effective Altruism which is like the broader sort of movement or idea space of which 80,000 Hours is a part. Just broadly focused on trying to do good in you know, an efficient and optimal way and I forget what the context was. But basically someone was getting very upset with the idea of Effective Altruism for this reason that they felt doing good shouldn't involve being calculating or analytical. And he eventually said, "God forbid we should actually you know, save people from drowning rather than just calculating the optimal way to do good". I don't even know how to respond to something like that, because of course the whole point of being calculating it so that you can save people from drowning, that you can save people. 

Which was a preamble to asking you Ben, whether you run into this difficulty in pitching the ideology of 80,000 hours or you know, if not, how have you done it? What is what is the way you've figured out to convey these ideas to people without invoking this reaction?

**Massimo**: And another way actually to to ask the same question is to think in terms of think of the philosophy underlying 80,000 as essentially a utilitarian, consequentialist philosophy. So how do you deal with, you know, deontologists or virtue ethicists would say, well, I don't buying the whole premise.

**Ben**: Well, so that I mean that was what I was alluding to in my my previous point is that I think, you know, only a really extreme deontologist would think that you shouldn't you know, care whatsoever about the impact on people's lives of your actions. You should just follow the rules. And I mean even if you you might just more like a more normal position would be you should follow the rules, but then that gives you a whole set of permissible actions and from within those, the ones which are morally better are the ones that help more people live better lives. Even if maybe those aren't it's not necessary to do those, but they're still like praiseworthy, morally praiseworthy to do. And because of the world we live in, actually, there are very large differences in the welfare impacts of different actions. And that means that even a deontologist, and you know, it comes into virtue ethics because benevolence is a virtue we'll still need to think quite seriously about the effects of their actions on people's lives. Even if they're not utilitarian, and think that that's the only thing that matters.

**Massimo**: I think you're right. I mean, you know, one way to couch this is to remind people that although of course consequentialism is in fact, you know, by definition about consequences. Or utilitarianism is by definition about sort of utility calculus of some sort. And certainly the way we've been talking about 80,000 does sort of put it put it forth as is essentially utilitarian in exercising utilitarian calculus from a social perspective. But it's also good to remember that deontology, you know, deontological approach, or virtue ethical approach to ethics, to morality themselves, they do deal with consequences, not like they ignore consequences. And it's just that the consequences are part of a of a broader or a different way of looking at ethical issues while in the case of utilitarianism, they are the focal and overriding approach, that's that there's a difference there, but it's not that the consequences are important only for consequentialist and everybody else says, you know, well, damn it, I don't care about the consequences.

**Julia**: Well, it's not just that the consequences are only part of the picture for non utilitarians it's that they don't care. They don't seem to care particularly much about the magnitude of the consequences. So, you know, a someone who identifies a deontologist or her acts that way, even if they've never heard the term might care about the impact of their actions on other people. And as a result they want to say be a doctor or work at a soup kitchen so that they can directly help people. And the argument that oh but you could help so many more people, you know, by taking this other career won't be that persuasive to them. Or in fact in practice does not seem to be that persuasive again because as long as they're being virtuous by having good consequences, it sort of doesn't matter, you know that they could do more.

**Ben**: Yeah, I mean, so I think from the perspective of moral philosophy, if there was a there was a path where you know, becoming a doctor, you save 100 lives, but taking some other path, you saved 200 lives, then just, you know, really simplifying what we mean by impact down to saving lives then like most moral systems with probably like really strongly encourage you to do the 200 lives thing. and the people who like to think that it doesn't matter that you're effectively letting 100 people die would you know, from a moral point of view, they would, I think like you should, like, most people would agree that that's that's a really bad thing. Yeah, although whether they are persuaded by that on a gut level and act on it is a completely different thing, right?

**Massimo**: Let's not forget however, that there are such sort of extremely deontologists, of course the most famous example of it being Kant himself who said something on the lines, although you need to you do need to read in context because it's a little more nuanced than than it's gonna sound in a second. But it did say that, you know, "the moral law is what matters even at the cost of, you know, so the destruction of the world" and you would you would think that the obvious question there is well matter to whom if the world has been destroyed-

**Julia**: -Fortunately, not that many people have actually read Kant.

**Ben**: I didn't think that's a very reasonable position, even if even if that was Kant's position.

**Julia**: All right, well, we are just about out of time for this section of the podcast Ben, so I'm going to wrap things up and we'll move on to the Rationally Speaking Picks. 

**Massimo**: Okay, welcome back. Every episode we pick a suggestion for our listeners that has tickled our rational fancy. This time we ask our guest Ben Todd for his suggestion. Ben?

**Ben**: So I'd like to suggest you check out the Open Philanthropy Project, which is at openphilanthropyproject.org. And it was recently well, it's part of Givewell, which is a charity evaluator. It helps people find nonprofits where you can have a large impact per dollar if you donate to them. And it's well known for focusing on international development nonprofits, such as Against Malaria Foundation, which distributes malaria bed nets and Give Directly, which does cash transfers to Kenyan farmers. But so it's very associated with these kind of simple interventions which help people in the developing world.

Less people are aware that in 2012 Givewell partnered with Good Ventures, which is a multibillion dollar foundation set up by Cari Tuna and Dustin Moskovitz, who's one of the co founders of Facebook, and they've now formed a project which is branded separately called the Open Philanthropy Project and its aims is to spend those several billion dollars in the way that has the largest social impact according to their values, which they they expressed generally as global humanitarianism. So the main thing being that people's lives have equal value.

And so they're setting out to spend that money in the way that has the biggest impact. And as they go there explaining all of their reasoning in a lot of depth on so far they Givewell blog. but now you can see some of the highlights on the Open Philanthropy Project website and it makes really fascinating reading because I think it's the first project of this kind which is set out with this kind of aim and which is also communicated it so transparently.

And it's focusing on a much wider range of causes than traditional Givewell, currently they're focusing on international element which is the same as Givewell, but then also three other causes. One being policy advocacy and they're interested in things like penal reform, the third being scientific research, especially biomedical research and the fourth being global catastrophic risks, which are kind of low probability but really a potentially catastrophic events. So within there they're interested in things like geoengineering research, risks from machine intelligence and the last one, oh yes, synthetic biology research. So they're really taking a very broad approach to working out what to do with the money. And yeah, really fascinating, really fascinating reading.

**Massimo**: Yeah, it's interesting you mentioned, Givewell, I should remind our listeners that we actually had a conversation with Holden Karnowski on evidence based philanthropy and Givewell back in episode 38 of Rationally Speaking. Right, So thank you. Thanks for the suggestion.

**Julia**: Yeah, I will second that recommendation of the Open Philanthropy Project and Givewell blog which for anyone who's interested in logic and evidence and reason, I think their blog posts are more satisfying than most science and philosophy to read, just because it's you know, not only sort of utilitarian explorations of applications of utilitarianism, but also how do you evaluate evidence? What kind of epistemological principles should you be using to evaluate these complex topics? So it's these like abstract, intellectually interesting topics, but, you know, applied to real world practical questions, so sort of an unusual overlap. Anyway, yes, point being, I agree.

Ben, thank you so much for joining us. It's been a pleasure to chat with you.
