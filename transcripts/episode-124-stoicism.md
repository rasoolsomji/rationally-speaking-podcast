**Massimo**: Welcome to Rationally Speaking, the podcast where we explore the borderlands between reason and nonsense. I'm your host, Massimo Pigliucci and with me, as always, is my co host, Julia Galef. Julia, What are we going to talk about today?

**Julia**: Well, Massimo, this episode comes hot on the heels of international Stoic week 2014, which is a week in which participants are encouraged to try living by the precepts of the ancient Greco-Roman philosophy of Stoicism. And so more broadly, this episode is going to be about not just the results of that experiment which Massimo participated in, but also what Stoicism is, how it can be useful in modern life and maybe some potential problems or, I don't know, nuances to it. Uh so well, before I ask you Massimo about the results of your experiment in participating in Stoicism last month, maybe we should just sort of check and make sure we are on the same page about what Stoicism is because I found this a little bit difficult to pin down actually.

My cursory, like I've read some Stoic philosophers so my attempt at defining what it is would be - a philosophy of living, I'll focus just on the sort of how-to-live parts, not on the metaphysics through the logic per se. A philosophy of living that encourages you to shed or diminish negative emotions. Specifically by recognizing what is and isn't under your control and not feeling negatively about the things that you can't control and also sort of seeing the world deterministically like understanding the mechanisms that cause things to happen. To help diminish the sense of outrage or injustice that you feel when for example, someone does something, you know, that seems evil which is not to say that like you shouldn't try to change that if you think that that's possible or feasible, but that you feel less of that sense of sort of helpless outrage because you understand, what it is about their brain chemistry and circumstances and maybe their upbringing or whatnot that caused that to happen. So it doesn't feel, you know, it doesn't affect you quite as much. Oh, and then last I would say like recognizing or trying to diminish that gap between how you want the world to be and how the world is, not necessarily by changing the world, but by changing how you want the world to be, your like letting go of your sort of emotional need for that gap to close.

**Massimo**: Yeah, that sounds good. It's interesting to me that you focused on the very, the most practical part of Stoicism is except I guess actually you did sneak in a little bit of metaphysics there because when you said the Stoics correctly, are essentially determinist by modern standards or causalists at the very least then definitely that's a bit of metaphysical. Um, yeah, that's that's definitely um, one way of thinking about Stoicism I would like to go a little broader, however, and sort of present stoicism as you pointed out, it's it's a Greek Roman philosophy started out in Hellenistic Greece. Um, so you know after Plato Socrates and Aristotle, in fact, it was started by Zeno City(?) in Athens and it takes its name Stoicism from the store, which is this covered portico in Athens where people just met for for transactionally chatting and all that sort of stuff. And the Stoic, the first Stoic philosophers were meeting as a group in that kind of open public environment.

At the time, there were several other schools of philosophy that we still know of today, right? There was Epicurianism there were the Cynics in the original sense of the term, not in in the sense of people who don't believe in anything or reject everything or are sarcastic about everything-

**Julia**: -Or complain excessively on Facebook about Christmas music and Christmas decorations-

**Massimo**: -Precisely, not that kind of Cynic. There were of course people, you know, students of that were still going to Plato's Academy although Plato isn't necessarily active anymore or was dead in fact. You know the Aristotle's lyceum. So there is a number of and of course the Epicureans. So there was there were a number of competing philosophies at the time in Greece. That then of course immediately spilled over in first in Republican Rome and then Imperial Rome Stoicism in particular became dominant in Imperial Rome.

All of these were practically oriented schools of philosophy. That is, even though each one of them came within metaphysics came with you know a theory of knowledge essentially so epistemology and that sort of stuff. They were all especially Stoicism Epicureanism and Cynicism, they were all very practically geared. They intended philosophy as a way of figuring out how to live the good life. And in fact they all had similar definitions of what a good life consists of. I mean these are all variations on what today we call still virtue ethics, which of course was canonized by Aristotle in the Nicomachean ethics.

But virtue ethics is a way of thinking of ethics that is very different from modern times. And we talked about this in the past and on the podcast. But basically today when you talk about ethics or morality that the typical question comes to mind is oh this is about figuring out what's right, what is right and what is wrong. For the ancients the word ethics conjured up decisions about how to live one's life. The study of ethics was the study of figuring out how to live a good life, which meant a moral life of course, which did imply answers to questions of right and wrong, but those were sort of ancillary to the basic idea of virtue.

So for the stoics in particular, just like for Aristotle, although in fact even more so than for Aristotle, the good life was essentially a moral life, a life of cultivating the virtues. Now Aristotle had because he loved taxonomy, he had a long list of virtues. I think he had 12 or something like that. The Stoics really were much more simple about about how to go about this thing, essentially that recognized four virtues which are still termed today the cardinal virtues because they've been incorporated essentially in the Christian tradition as well, which took a lot from Stoicism.

And the four cardinal virtues are courage or generally defined as in so the ability to withstand hardship of some sort, wisdom or the ability to find out what is the best way to do under the circumstances in a broad, in a broad sense, self control, and justice or equanimity, the ability to figure out where there are competing demands where the just middle or the just compromise lies.

So the Stoics really, in terms of practice, were very much followers of virtue ethics for them that was the cardinal point. From that one all of the other stuff that you're talking about sort of derives because their idea that in life, you need to figure out what you can, you know, to distinguish what you can do and what you cannot do, what you can alter and what you cannot alter. This is this comes from Dictatus(?) one of the major Stoic philosophers who was a former slave by the way in Ancient Rome. That idea is very practical because as you were pointing out a minute ago, it allows one to figure out that there are certain things that it's just useless and wasteful to get upset about because they're outside of your control, and the things that are mostly under your control are your own mental attitudes are how you react and how you think about certain things.

Now this is actually difficult, more difficult to practice than people might think but actually practical practicing Stoics say that this actually does help. This has actually a lot of connections with modern, certain kinds of modern psychotherapeutic practice, in particular local(?) therapy, and more broadly cognitive behavioral therapy. These are kinds of therapies that actually are in fact evidence based. I mean, there's there's a lot of evidence about the efficacy of these kind of therapeutic approaches that have directly incorporated a lot of the precepts of Stoicism.

So anyway, the broader idea is that I think of Stoicism as these virtue ethics based philosophy, very practical, but also you know, built on a certain kind of views of the world, including metaphysical views of the world and particularly the idea of universal causality, which I think works very well actually even with the picture of the world that comes out of modern science.

**Julia**: Well, maybe you could talk a bit about how all these different parts of Stoicism have affected the way that you live or the way that you see the world. Either you know, last month, during Stoic week or sort of more broadly, I know you've been writing about Stoicism, you know, a fair amount recently, it seems like it's sort of found its way more into your psyche in recent months or maybe years and it wasn't just a one off experiment for, you.

**Massimo**: You know, that's right. So it's kind of funny I have had an interested in Stoicism for a long while simply because I'm Roman and you know, just like a lot of people probably that practiced Buddhism, which by the way, has a lot of similarities actually with Stoicism. You know, often the reason you're Buddhist is because you grew up in a Buddhist country and that's what you learned. Of course it's not the only reason and there are plenty of people who are not who didn't grow up in India who are practicing Buddhism and the same goes of course, for Stoicism.

But initially, you know many years ago when I was much younger my interest in Stoicism came out of the fact that I was studying in high school and this was part of the Roman tradition and part of the stuff that you know the Roman philosophy that you would study. But then it fit in the background for a long time. Partly because my general interest in philosophy was in the background for a long time during my career as a scientist, but also partly because it's like okay well there's just one philosophy among many and I wasn't at the time looking for a philosophical approach to life in general. I wasn't really very familiar with virtue ethics and that sort of stuff.

Now in recent times I've been more interested in sort of on and off in Stoicism I read a few things here and there and then finally  two or three months ago I decided that okay, why don't we give it a serious try. So I decided to practice Stoicism not only study it more closely than I've ever done before, but actually practice it for a year. So that's my my own self imposed deadline, so until about October of 2015 basically. And see what happens, you know, see if it actually does feel like something that I want to pursue further, something that is actually making a significant difference in my life and so on and so forth.

But more more recently than that, as you mentioned, I participated in Stoic week. It's an interesting exercises part philosophy and part social science experiment. It's run by a group of people at Exeter University in in England where there is a group that studies Stoicism. And they're very connected to people who actually practice professionally cognitive behavioral therapy and similar types of therapy.

So what they do basically every year and it's the last week in November which is easier for Americans to remember. It's thanksgiving week. They asked people that are interested in doing the experiment to register to their website. You take a number of questionnaires. I think there's four different questionnaires and different aspects of your thinking about life in general, your self satisfaction with life in general. And also more specifically about Stoic precepts and Stoic behaviors. And then you download a handbook, a manual for doing Stoic week. The handbook is updated every year. This is the 2014 edition is of course available for download any time. I mean, people can do it at any time and it's very well put together. It's got a different theme every day. And it sort of guides you throughout the practices which we're going to hopefully talk about in a minute in more detail.

And then at the end of the week, you take the sort of these exit questionnaires and then the people in Exeter use the data. They've been using the data for the last three years since they started doing this Stoic week. To see if in fact there is a change in behavior, a change in attitudes and so on so forth as a result of practicing Stoicism. This is not the only experiment that they do, but this is the major one so far.

It has of course, obvious limitations. First of all, this is a self selected group of people who are already interested in Stoicism to begin with. Right. Second of all, it's not a controlled experiment. It's only a before and after sort of questionnaires. Right? So, all the changes are relative to whatever the baseline already is, but you don't have a control for non Stoics or a control for people that practice something else. This is something, of course that the people at Exeter are aware of and they're working on. But to do it better to do in a more controlled experiment, they really need to get funding for doing a serious social science experiment.

**Julia**: It's also not blind, of course, that would be hard to adjust, hard to imagine what the, you know, placebo form of Stoicism would be.

**Massimo**: Exactly. Nonetheless, it's interesting to me because it is an attempt at least to collect systematic data and to do it over, you know, increasingly long period of time and fairly large sample size. I mean several thousand people register for Stoic week every year. So it's kind of interesting that they actually try to do that. Although my personal interest is in to see if the practice works for me personally regardless. So, you know, whether statistically there are differences or not, which by the way, there seemed to be in-

**Julia**: -There seems to be differences in the broader, in the sample, not just you? Do you know what they are?

**Massimo**: Yes, I don't have the data in front of me, but basically what they observed is every year now is statistically significant and in fairly large effect size in changes in attitude about things. For instance, people report higher level of self satisfaction and optimism and feeling of being more controlling what happens in their life. All of these indicators increase by anywhere between 10, 15 or 20% or something like that. Those are the effect size in between the beginning of the week and the end of the week.

And of course, because the experiment only lasts one week, those are actually fairly large numbers now. They have I think they ran last last year, a follow up to six months down the road for some people who actually had continued to practice afterwards and the numbers stayed there, in fact, if not even increased. But that kind of long term follow up is more more tentative.

**Julia**: Interesting. It's also kind of funnily ironic, I guess that a key tenet of Stoicism is accepting that a lot of things are out of your control. And yet people reported feeling more in control of their lives.

**Massimo**: Well, yeah, good. That's a good point. But remember for a Stoic feeling in control of your life actually basically means that you change your mental attitude about what's going on, right?

**Julia**: Shifted your locus of control I guess?

**Massimo**: That's right. So there's there's this I think he's an Australian comedian. We should add the link to this little bit that he has done just before Stoic week about Stoicism. And he sort of introduces the basic precepts of Stoicism with short comedy routine. And one of the things that he says is, well, you know, my mother in law doesn't upset me, my thoughts about her do however.

**Julia**: That's actually a very useful distinction to make. Massimo, what was actually, what was the intervention? Like was it just people participating in Stoic week, read this description of Stoicism and then decide to apply it however they want to whatever degree they want. Or was it something more specifically?

**Massimo**: It's much more specific. So let me give you the brief rundown of what was happening and which is essentially what I've been doing for the last 2.5 months, actually, not just for Stoic week, but this is the basic idea. You start out the day with a morning meditation and the word meditation by the way, although it's obviously the same word that we use for in Buddhism, it's actually a very different kind of meditation.

So it works like this. You started with one meditation which which includes a number of components.

One component is simply to try to mentally rehearse possible challenges or foreseeable challenges that you have at the day ahead. And recall to yourself what kind of virtues you might need to call on in order to deal with those challenges. So it's a sort of a preparatory exercise for for potential problems you might have during the day.

The second exercise that I do in the morning is what they called, what the Stoics called "The View From Above". The view from above is this mental presentation is not just verbal, you're supposed to visualize this. And you start with yourself and then you expand this circle. You zoom out basically. You start thinking about your close relatives, people that are important to you and then your close friends and then your entire city and then your country and then finally planet Earth. And then you zoom out even further out and you start thinking and visualizing the fact that you know, it's a planet in the solar system. It's a solar system, in a galaxy, is a galaxy in a bunch of other galaxies-

**Julia**: -So you're essentially creating the total perspective vortex in mind every morning.

**Massimo**: Correct. Yeah, you're supposed to do it as I said visually, then the third thing that I do, it sounds even less relaxing. This is an important Stoic practice, which the Romans called premeditatio malorum which literally means forcing bad stuff. And what it is, is, you pick one, a different one every day but you imagine yourself something really bad happening to yourself. So like losing your job or losing a close friend or a close relative or you know falling sick or some other including by the way, occasionally is supposed to do your own death, imagine your own death.

And this is not verbal. Again, it's visual, which means by the way that some people actually find really disturbing, in which case the advice is just don't do it until you feel like you can handle it. Why doing that? Because the idea is that you do that and by doing it over and over, you convince yourself so you realize and accept the fact that well all of these are bad things. But they are what the what the Stoics called 'dispreferred indifferents'.

**Julia**: That's not a very human phrase.

**Massimo**: No, but let me tell you exactly what that means because that actually often generates a lot of misunderstandings about Stoics. So there dispreferred for obvious reasons, right? I mean, you prefer to live rather than die you prefer to be healthy rather than sick. You prefer to be wealthy rather than poor and so on and so forth. Right? So they're dispreferred in that sense. They are indifferent in the very specific historic sense that they do not change your moral value, your character, who you are as a person. Your value as a moral person. Okay? So even if you become, in other words, that means you can be a virtuous person, regardless of whether you're healthy or sick, you're poor or rich, you have a job or you don't, and so on and so forth. And so it's a way to remind yourself that there are some things that are worth pursuing and other things that are yes, preferred, but they're not crucial to your life. They're not as overwhelming as most people seem to think. So that's the third type of exercise. And then finally-

**Julia**: -Actually can we pause on this for a moment? Because I will just say for context that I'm in general a fan of Stoicism, I like, I don't know, 75/80% agree with it or endorse it. And I think most people in the world could benefit from being somewhat more Stoic. But that said I have a handful of issues with it and you just touched on one of them. So would it be fair first off to characterize this third step as a negative visualization?

**Massimo**: Not exactly, in fact, no, because negative visualization actually there is evidence that doesn't doesn't really have positive effects.

**Julia**: Oh I actually had not even heard that evidence, we have anecdata for myself. So what I was trying to talk about, which actually maybe doesn't fall into the heading of negative visualization is the kind of thing that Epictetus was talking about when he said you know when you kiss your child remember that she will die someday any day. And that you should just always like whenever you would otherwise be experiencing pleasure and enjoying something, you should be visualizing, losing that any moment. And that this I think the point was partly that this will make you appreciate the moment more, but also that you know, you won't be as attached to that pleasure and you will be more prepared for losing it.

And this is something to me, this seems almost like an empirical question that depends on how likely it is that you actually will lose the thing and you know, how likely it is that you will need to have been prepared, or I guess how much you will benefit from having been prepared. And then on the other hand, how much suffering you incur by doing the preparation. And it it just has not really been clear to me that the benefits of doing that preparation outweigh the costs of the preparation. And in fact, I think a fair amount of modern cognitive science research has to me, it seemed to undermine some of the purported benefits, benefits of these kinds of exercises, like for example, the fact that we actually adjust more quickly than we expect to to tragedies that seems to undermine the alleged benefit of preparing ourselves incessantly for these tragedies. What do you think?

**Massimo**: Those are all fair points. I think there is a couple of considerations to make number one, as you said this in part. I think it's an empirical question, in part really is a question of sort of a way of choosing on how to think about certain things. Stoicism, just like any other philosophy, I think, or any other way of life isn't gonna work for everybody. And so if you're the kind of person that reacts negatively to, you know, that kind of sort of negative or distancing visualization, then don't do it, then it may not be for you.

But there are people on the other hand that find that comforting, the ability to visualize and getting familiar with that sort of situation may help them. So this is obviously that is an empirical question and some people will respond in one way and other people responding other way. But there are some of these things that will happen regardless, Right? I mean, you know, I may never lose my job. You know, I hope not. I may never find myself poor or something like that, but I I will die and I will lose you know, people that I care for and that sort of stuff. So to me what resonates in particular with that kind of exercise the premeditatio malorum is that it speaks to me as a way of thinking about loss and a way of thinking about big problems. So in that sense I find it comforting now you know how I will actually react when something like that is going to happen, we'll see I guess. That definitely is an empirical question. But I don't, not only I don't mind the the visualization, I actually find it comforting in the moment when I'm doing it right. But you're right, otherwise it is in fact an empirical question.

By the way the Stoics, before I go on, I'd like to sort of finish describing the typical day, because I think it's interesting, but one of the things about Stoicism is that the Stoics themselves were very open to criticism from other schools of thought. In particular, the Skeptics were very critical of the of the Stoics and in fact the early Stoics and the middle Stoics and then the late Stoics in the Roman empire. They actually had different ways of reacting to criticism that they, you know, they had changed some of their practices and some of their basic philosophy.

In fact, there's a famous quote by Seneca who was a Roman senator, an adviser, infamously advisor to Nero the emperor. The guy who burnt Rome for the record. Seneca said very clearly there is a, is a very nice, quoting one of these letters that says, you know, there's plenty of truths that need to be discovered and future generations will, and you know, we that is the reason we listen to our current, you know, people who currently have the best knowledge that we have is not because there are masters. There's simply people who know and we learn from, but they could be wrong and future generations will say so, and if that's the case then we'll change the way we do things. So it's a very one of the nice things about it that from the beginning it's very empirically minded approach to things. And it's very it's very open to change.

**Julia**: And possibly also a result of the fact that Stoicism is all about, you know, not taking insults personally and not getting defensive or all these things that get in the way of us updating based on arguments and evidence.

**Massimo**: Yes, you're right. So anyway, in terms of the day, so the morning meditation ends with picking a Stoic saying from my increasing, you know, enlarging collection of Stoic sayings which I have actually made available online for people to download. It's a spreadsheet right now, it's got more than 70 entries. Basically what happens is while I read the ancient you know, the ancient sources, mostly Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius and Seneca. I pick interesting sort of sayings and phrases and then I what you do is you you're supposed to pick one of those every day and sort of read it two or three times over it, or think about it for a second and just let it go.

So that's the morning meditation.  During the day, the major thing that you're supposed to do, there are several different types of what they call "spiritual exercises", and I use the word in quotation marks here because we're not talking is not a religion for one thing, but there are different kind of spiritual exercises, but the main thing that you can do if you have time during the day, but the main thing is that you're supposed to be engaging in mindfulness.

Mindfulness here means a very specific thing, which again, is very different from the Buddhist concept, although there is actually a variety of Buddhist concepts and mindfulness to be fair. So depending on which Buddhism you're talking about, but in terms of stories is mindfulness means largely two things.

First of all, it means to actually pay attention to what you're doing trying to establish what modern psychologists call a 'flow' of in your activities. So being completely in the moment, the Latins had a phrase for this hic at nunc, which means here now. And because the idea is that first of all, you'll do things better, Epictetus explicitly says, you know, give me an example of something that you did better by not paying attention to it.

And so that's part of the idea, but more importantly, mindfulness means being mindful that every time, you know during the day several times you will make judgment calls, you will arrive at certain decisions based on your judgment on a particular situation. And in those cases you always have to keep in mind that that judgment is largely about the attitude that you're going to have about some external events. So something it's going to happen, your mother in law, to use the example of the comedian that I referred to earlier, is going to tell you something and now you have a choice, a judgment call on how to react to it. So be mindful that you will have that choice. You will have a possibility of reacting one way or the other and there's some ways of reacting are better than others.

So that's what you're supposed to do during the day. And finally in the evening before going to bed, you're supposed to do an evening meditation. The evening meditation is essentially almost sort of the reverse of the morning one, an abbreviated form is, and you can do it, I do it as a diary. So you, you write down things but you don't have to. And the idea is that you go over the day, and what has happened during the day and you ask yourself three fundamental questions.

First of all, what did I do right? And you pat yourself on the back for that. Second, what did I do wrong? And you forgive yourself for that, but you keep it in mind so that you're not gonna do it again and then what is it that I didn't do, but could have done? Sort of rehearsing again, your decisions during the day and say ah actually I could have done this and maybe next time I should do this and that's it. So and the idea Seneca says it's to sort of clear your mind, learn from what you've done during the day and then go to bed you know and rest because you deserve that you learned something from your day, you were not perfect but you know tomorrow's gonna be another day and you're gonna be better equipped because you've reflected on what you did right and what you did wrong.

**Julia**: So okay, to some extent, I'm not surprised that this collection of I don't know techniques or practices has positive effects because it overlaps so much with established wisdom in psychology and even in business like the practice of you know reflecting on what went right and what went wrong, like doing a postmortem. And then putting I don't know policies in place to make things go well or you know, avoid things going poorly in the future, that's that's pretty well established. And the research on mindfulness also shows that actually this is relatively recent. But when happiness researchers have pinned people to see how happy they are at different points in their day, the biggest by far predictor of whether people were actually happy is whether they were being mindful, whether they were in the moment, whether they were in flow. And that was true, even if you control for whether the activity they were doing was, you know, savory or unsavory. It's interesting. And then there's also gratitude meditations where people are encouraged to, you know, make a list every day of things that they're grateful for that they appreciate. And this is also like a reliable way to increase happiness. But the thing that I'm more interested in is the aspect of Stoicism that makes it really unique, which to my mind is the like the you know, letting go of your desire to make the world conform to how you want it to be basically. That may not have been the best way to say it, but I'm curious how much of that you've experimented with. And you know, if so what the effects have been.

**Massimo**: Yeah, that's a fundamental precept of Stoicism although I think we should give the Stoics you know, their due for the other stuff because as you say, yeah a lot of these things are now well established, supported in business practice and advice as well as modern psychology. But those were the guys who came up with it.

**Julia**: I remember when I was a kid I used to read a lot of like pulp fantasy and sci-fi, I loved it. And then finally my dad got me to read Lord of the Rings and after about it, he asked me what I thought and I was like, well it was kind of cliche, you know, there were orcs, wizards, you know, there's a dragon like and I just hadn't realized that Tolkein like invented most of those cliches.

**Massimo**: Exactly, but setting that aside, I mean it's a fair point by setting that aside. Yeah, what you're talking about, this idea that you have that there's a lot of that hinges on your mental attitude, on your on the distinction between what you can and you cannot change is a fundamental precept of Stoicism and it actually has been incorporated in other practices. I mean, other than the cognitive behavioral therapy that I mentioned earlier. If you think about the serenity prayer for instance, that alcoholic anonymous starts their meeting with that's essentially a Stoic precept as I mentioned.

Yeah, as I mentioned earlier, Christianity did take a lot of Stoicism on board and if I may just a little bit of a side note here, the two major rival philosophies when Christianity arose within the Roman empire, were in fact rivals to Christianity where Stoicism and Epicureanism. And it's interesting to me how the Christians, the early Christians reacted to those two schools, they incorporated as much as possible of Stoicism and they rejected and ridiculed Epicureanism, I mean one of the reasons still today people think that Epicureanism is about sex, drugs and rock and roll,  which is not, it is precisely because, so this smearing campaign basically that sustained smearing campaign, the early Christians did about Epicureans.

And I think there is an interesting reason for why, by the way that happened. I mean, this is my own theory. I don't claim to be an expert in sort of ancient sources on this, but I think it would be interesting if somebody looked into it or maybe somebody has looked into it and the difference between the Stoicism and Epicureanism from the Christian perspective is that Epicureans, although neither one of those, two groups were actually atheists. A lot of people today think that Epicurus was an atheist. He was not, he was more like a deist in fact, both Stoics and, Epicurus were essentially deists.

But the Epicureans from a point of view of sort of metaphysics, they really thought that everything was a random, that things came out the universe came out out of a random void of random movement in the in the world, which was entirely incompatible with Christian metaphysics.

The Stoics on the other hand, thought that there is a logos, there is a rational principle to the universe, which if you're deistically inclined, you can call it God, right? But if you're not, like many, most modern Stoics are not necessarily religious, then you can simply say, you know, the universe seems to be constructed or reflecting, you know, sort of logical, mathematical rational principles. I mean, we had if you remember Max Tegmark for instance, on our podcast, he of the universal mathematical hypothesis. Well, that's essentially very compatible with Stoic metaphysics. So the Christians were, but the point of the logos, you know, the concept the logos was much easier to incorporate into Christianity because that's the idea of a God that creates the universe and for the, in certain things and then things just work in the way in which they have been for the end. So I think that there's an interesting reason. There may be an interesting reason why Stoicism unlike Epicureans was sort of incorporated into Christian philosophy.

Anyway, we were talking about this fundamental idea of making a distinction between what you can affect, what you cannot affect.

**Julia**: Yeah, and I can just add briefly why I'm interested in it, because I may not be fully understanding it. I'll add that disclaimer, but it seems to me that like letting go of your desire to close that gap between what is and what you want to be, seems like it could encourage fatalism where, you know, I've no drive to change the world because I can just reframe it and be okay with how things are. Or even if you sort of intellectually believe that like things would be better in some abstract way. You know, if you change the world, if you don't have that emotional drive to want things to be different, it's hard to imagine how you could motivate action.

**Massimo**: I'm so glad you said that, because those are, you just mentioned two of the most common misunderstandings in Stoicism and so we need we really need to talk about those. So the image you just conjured especially the latter, the second one, the one about being unemotional about things, or emotionally detached about things. It doesn't remind you of somebody in one of our favorite fictional character?

**Julia**: Mr Straw Vulcan?

**Massimo**: Exactly, Mr Spock. Now as it turns out, Gene Roddenberry consciously modeled Spock after Stoicism except of course that the Roddenberry had a little bit of a you know, sort of the everyday men view of Stoicism, which was not exactly correct. And particularly the part that is not correct is the part about sort of emotional detachment in that sense, in the in the Spock's sense. So the idea in Stoicism is this is not to be emotionally detached and in fact Stoics themselves referred to their philosophy as a philosophy of love and of love of humankind and nature itself, broadly speaking, there's this image in Stoicism of you know, as I mentioned, the expanding circle that should be an expanding circle of concern. It's a very modern idea that one of our former guests, Peter Singer, the Utilitarian philosopher, also has written about from obviously from a Utilitarian perspective, not from a Stoic one, but so the Stoics are very much into social change. There were very much into concern for other people, their family, their friends and the society at large. I mean think about the fact that most of the, you know, famous Stoics were you know, generals, senators, emperors, people like that.

**Julia**: These were so interesting to me. It's so confusing. Like I agree that in practice the practitioners of stoicism, at least the most famous ones are not, you know, sitting back on their laurels, just reframing everything rather than acting. And yet when I read quotes from, you know their writings, it doesn't make sense to me why they are actually out there, changing the world, I'm having a hard time making that connection.

**Massimo**: Yeah, it can be confusing, I think that the best of the best explanation of this attitude probably is found in Marcus Aurelius who was actually Roman emperor. And what he said, what Marcus says is something along the lines, I'm not quoting directly because I don't have the book  in front of me. But it's something on the lines of you know, if there is a problem, especially, you know, something in society that you think you can change by all means go ahead with all your energy and try to change it. But once the deed is done, once you tried your best and you know there is a particular outcome, right, then you have to have the mental serenity to accept the outcome regardless of what it was because otherwise you're wasting a lot of energy, you're doing something. If you try to engage in sort of a counterfactual thinking, you know, what would have happened if I had done this or that or the other. You're wasting a lot of emotional and psychic energies because you can't do anything else. Whatever you've done, it's done. And so what you need to do is to accept the outcome at peace, knowing that you tried your best and then try again the next time that you have an opportunity.

**Julia**: So it's a fatalism about the past, not about the future.

**Massimo**: That's right. It's in fact, the Stoics explicitly say it's this is depicted as it's useless to spend time thinking about the past because you can't change it anymore. It's also not particularly useful to think too much about the future, especially the distant future because you have very little control over it. But what you can do is what you can affect what's happening right now. Hence, again, the connection with mindfulness and, you know, being in the flow right? So you can make decisions now, that will affect events. You are an active participant in the universal drama, so to speak. But once the thing is done, you're just wasting your energy by, you know, dwelling on on it. And I think this is actually something that even modern psychology recognizes that there is a, people who tend to spend too much time sort of rehearsing over and over things that they could have done different or something, and they're not getting anything positive out of it. They sort of get upset and you get frustrated by that. And the Stoics said, why, why do that? It's done and and you have absolutely no control over it, so you should focus on the things you do have control over.

**Julia**: I mean that I don't disagree with. It's just there seemed to be a bunch of quotations that go beyond the, you know, don't obsess about past outcomes policy. Like Epictetus says, "permit nothing to grow to you that may give you agony when it is torn away". "Freedom is secured not by the fulfilling of desires, but by the removal of desire". I don't think it's that ridiculous for people to think that the Stoics were advocating, you know, getting rid of desire and love and attachment and all these very human emotions.

**Massimo**: No, it isn't. But that is often is in fact the result of sort of picking on a quote or another quote, which is of course what lots of people do. And this is not just a problem with Stoicism. And you can you can do the same with Buddhism or any other philosophical approach to things and you find all sorts of contradictory things, part of it of course, is because some of them probably are in fact contradictory, right? I mean, we're talking about a tradition that even just in the ancient world was very active and flourishing for more than half a millennium. So that's that's a lot of people and a lot of different ways of thinking and developing ideas. Right.

I mean, we consider that the overwhelming majority of the Stoic texts that we have today come from those three others that I mentioned earlier, Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. Especially Seneca. Seneca was the most active writer. But the estimate from scholars of those of those times is that we actually have less than 1% at best of the total stock output over that half a millennium. So who knows? And of course we do know some of the things that other Stoics had said, like you know Zeno, the founder of the school or Chrysippus who was the second head of the store. We know about them because of either what other Stoics have said, you know, quoting them or what other people who were sympathetic or sometimes critical of Stoicism had quoted them. For instance, one of the best Roman sources on Stoicism is Cicero who was not a Stoic, but he was sympathetic to the general idea. And so he quotes and talks a lot about Stoicism.

So in some sense you may be picking on real actual contradictions. Because these things, these ideas were developed over a long period of time by different people, but not in another sense, you know, the more I guess, I mean that's one of the things that actually concerns me as well. That's why I decided to, to not only read about modern Stoicism but actually go back. I'm reading, I'm rereading because I read in the past, but the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, I'm reading the Epictetus handbook and Seneca's letters and things like that precisely because I do want to have an idea of how just how much diversity and (?) so much, you know, incompatibility there is between these notions, but my reading so far is that if you read enough of the authors and you sort of connect the dots, you know, in a reasonably charitable way, which of course is what one would want to do if you want to learn something, then it seems like some of these contradictions actually much less contradictory than than one might think. Again, this is not, the idea that Stoicism was considered a philosophy of love and a philosophy of social engagement and so on and so forth. This is very clear in depicted by Marcus Aurelius. So it's not like I'm picking on one quotation and saying, well, yeah, they mentioned love over here. They seem to make it into a fundamental part of what they were trying to teach. But yeah, of course there's there's contradictions everywhere.

**Julia**: We're almost out of time, but I realized we never got to hear what the results were of your personal experiments so far in Stoicism.

**Massimo**: I'm so glad you asked. So I got the results which of course are meaningful up to a point because this is my first time I did Stoic week. What they do if you do it over a period of years, they also tell you, of course, how much your results have changed over time and that sort of stuff. But they do have some interesting comparison with the group, the database that already have. Now keep in mind of course, this is a database people who already are interested in Stoicism right, so all these statistics, if they were to be compared to a sort of a control population will probably be more you know, a stronger difference basically. But here's what my results have been on a number of issues. So first of all, they measure your flourishing scale, which is a series of questions about how just how, you know, satisfied you are with your life essentially. As a, as a eudemonic sense, as in you know, are you flourishing or not? Apparently I got 55 out of 56 is my score.

**Julia**: Whoa Mr. Flourisher!

**Massimo**: I know right, I'm definitely the top 10%. Now there is a different scale that they call satisfaction with life scale, which is less specifically oriented to sort of virtue, the virtual view of this radical view. On that one I got 33 out of 35, which is again very high, it indicates a high degree of satisfaction. They then asked me about my positive experiences. So how often I have positive experiences in my life and they list a number of them, you know that the questions are actually, the questionnaires are actually fairly detailed. And in terms of positive experiences, I'm 25 out of 30, so I tend to have mostly positive experiences in my life. They also ask you about your negative experiences in life and there I have a score of eight, the minimum is six. So I'm pretty close to the bottom, which makes sense. If you have a lot of positive experiences, then obviously you're going to have few rather a few negative experiences.

**Julia**: It would be a very interesting life. If you are high on both of those.

**Massimo**: That's right. So in fact the balance, they give you the balance between the two. So the balance between positive and negative, I score a 17 and there the range is -24 to +24. So 17 is obviously very much on the positive side. And then finally they actually score your Stoic attitudes and Stoic behaviors so the attitudes are how do you think about things? And of course the behavior is how do you actually behave about things? And how close those are to the sort of the precepts of Stoicism? And on the Stoic attitudes, I got a 70 out of 84 the average was 57 for the entire sample. And for the behaviors I got 46 out of 49, the average was at 30.6.

**Julia**: So your behaviors are actually more Stoic than your beliefs about Stoicism?

**Massimo**: I guess percentage-wise probably that, yes, that's probably the case. And you know why I think, because I scored the only, you can break it down of course by questions I'm just giving in the averages. The only major portion of the Stoic philosophy where I score low compared to the average is the question about do you think that there is a intelligently ordered or intelligent order to the universe? That is the things happen because somebody ordained them basically, which is the stand-

**Julia**: -Why would they put that on there?

**Massimo**: Because that is in fact the standard or ancient Stoicism was as a set of deist sort of philosophy. So that, you know, Epictetus in particular, different Stoics of course, had different emphasis on this, but Epictetus in particular did think that God created, was the source of the Logos, which is why, as I said earlier, the whole idea just worked very well within Christianity. Now, modern Stoic, most modern Stoics are not well, I don't, I shouldn't say most, but a good number I would think, modern Stoic are actually-

**Julia**: -I know that rates of theism among philosophers are extremely low. So I would expect for practicing Stoics that it would be somewhat similar.

**Massimo**: That's right. So, but I think that that is the the only question for where I have a very different score from, as an atheist of course, from your average Stoic. And so that brings down my attitudes, but the behaviors are more consistent. So it was fun. And it was interesting and it does feel like, has been, you know, these experiments so far has been making tangible difference in my everyday life. I mean, you know, just small things.

I mean, I can give you a couple of examples, you know, one of which is, you know, I go, it's for a number of years now, have been going to the gym every week, you know, week, two or three times a week because it's good for me. And, but I don't like it. I mean when, when I walk into my gym and the person that greets me says, enjoy your workout, I always think that he's kidding. It's like, what do you mean, enjoy your workout? I don't enjoy my work out, it's torture, but I do it because it's, you know, it's good for me. So as a result of that for years, I did what a lot of people doing, which is, you know, you go work out with your iPhone and your earphones and then listen to music or to a podcast or to whatever. In fact, I'm pretty sure that a lot of our listeners listen to our podcast that way.

Now when I started practicing Stoicism as I mentioned earlier, one of the ideas is mindfulness, right? So you need to pay attention to what you're doing. So I said, oh my gosh, can actually do this? Can I go to the gym and pay attention to the exercise itself? You know, forget the iPhone, forget the earphones, forget that, no podcast, no music, nothing like that. I thought this was going to be really difficult for me actually to do. And incidentally, by the way, when the Stoics tells you to do something like this, they don't tell it, they say it's going to have the positive side effect that you're gonna, it's gonna be good for your health because you exercise, let's say in this case, right? But the main reason or a main reason you want to do it is because it's actually a way to practice one of the virtues in this particular case, self control. So it's like, okay, let's try and I have to say I've stuck with it and it's now almost three months that I go to the gym with no music, no podcast, no nothing. And I do feel like I am getting more benefits because I'm of course paying attention to what I'm doing right, I'm paying attention to my muscles and how they're responding to the exercises. I am paying attention to my movements. And so I do think actually I'm getting, you know, more out of the experience than I was before.

**Julia**: Wow, well it will be the biggest victory for Stoicism if they can make me enjoy a media-free workout because I got to tell you, I get bored and antsy after just, you know, 20 seconds on the treadmill without a podcast, book, and TV show.

**Massimo**: I hear you my friend, but again, remember this is the way it's an excuse to practice virtue.

**Julia**: Yay...We are actually over time so shall we wrap up? Okay, excellent. We will move on then to the Rationally Speaking Picks.

**Massimo**: Welcome back every episode Julia and I pick a couple of our favorite books, movies, websites, or whatever tickles our rational fancy. Let's start as usual with Julia's pick.

**Julia**: Alright my pick is a blog. It has a sort of intimidatingly technical dry title. But bear with me, the blog is called Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science. It's the blog of someone whose name you might know if you follow anything about statistics or Bayesianism, his name is Andrew Gelman and he's one of the most famous Bayesian statisticians out there. He was actually my professor when I was at Columbia and I did some research assistant work for him.

The blog is actually it's like very conversational in tone. He certainly covers like he does critiques of research methods in social science, which is one of his areas of specialization, but he also has a blog posts on where he disagrees with Steven Pinker, cultural commentary, and it's all very thoughtful and measured and anytime there's any controversy about research or you know, statistics or sometimes even philosophy of science, I check to see if Andy Gelman has written anything about it because I think he does some great analysis. So if you appreciate stats, you'll definitely appreciate this blog. If you don't appreciate stats you might have to skip past some posts, but I think you'll still get something out of.

**Massimo**: Sounds interesting. My pick is an article that came out in the New York Times on 22 November. It's called Companions in Misery and the author is Mariana Alessandri who is an assistant professor of Philosophy at the University of Texas-Pan American.

**Julia**: Perfect for a Stoicism episode.

**Massimo**: It is, and in fact it does mention Stoicism, although in passing, so the idea the companions in misery are New Yorkers. So the article is about how these all these articles have come out recently saying how miserable New Yorkers are and they always complaining about stuff and all that, so why would anybody want to live in New York? And the article is not quite tongue in cheek, but sort of light hearted, take on that from somebody who is a native New Yorker. In fact, she's, the author has lived in New York for a long time, although now she's in Texas. And she mentions two, she manages to mention everybody from, you know, the Stoics to Schopenhauer to Sartre to Camus and so on and so forth.

And it's a very interesting analysis of, you know, at a very local level of what it means actually to live in New York, but at a broader level to how people react to certain sort of stressful conditions of life and actually not only thrive despite those conditions, but in fact in some kind of interesting sense, even enjoy them. And one of my favorite quotes from the article refers to Camus who wrote about the myth of Sisyphus right who was condemned to roll these this giant boulder up the hill and then the boulder will come down and then it will go back up and so on and so forth, right. Which is the since it's the epitome of a useless and frustrating task, right? And so she says, still Camus concludes, "One must imagine Sisyphus happy". And if Camus can imagine happiness for a man sentenced to an eternity of meaningless toil, perhaps we can do the same for dissatisfied New Yorkers.

**Julia**: Yay...

**Massimo**: But in fact, it's more it's a little bit more optimistic than that. But that was a great quote I thought. So anyway, the article is Companions in Misery is about life in New York and it's written by a philosopher.

**Julia**: Excellent. I'm sure our listeners who enjoy the sound of angry honking in the background of every episode will sympathize. All right, well, that about wraps it up. This concludes another episode of Rationally Speaking, join us next time for more explorations on the borderlands between reason and nonsense.
